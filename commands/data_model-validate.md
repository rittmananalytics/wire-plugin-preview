# Data Model Validation Command

## Purpose

Validate the generated data model specification and embedded Physical ERD against quality standards:
- All conceptual model entities are represented as warehouse models
- dbt naming conventions are followed throughout
- Every model has a defined grain, surrogate key, and test coverage plan
- The Physical ERD is present, complete, and consistent with the model specs
- All FK relationships in the ERD have corresponding join definitions in the model specs
- Cross-system joins are documented

## Usage

```bash
/wire:data_model-validate YYYYMMDD_project_name
```

## Prerequisites

- `data_model`: `generate: complete`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Verify Data Model Exists

1. Check `data_model.generate == complete` in `status.md`
2. Check that `design/data_model_specification.md` exists

If not found:
```
Error: Data model not yet generated.
Run: /wire:data_model-generate <project_id>
```

### Step 2: Read Inputs

1. Read `design/data_model_specification.md`
2. Read `design/conceptual_model.md` (for entity coverage cross-check)
3. Read `design/pipeline_architecture.md` (for source table cross-check)

### Step 3: Run Validation Checks

**Naming Convention Checks**:

| Check | Rule | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| Staging naming | All staging models follow `stg_<source>__<entity>` (double underscore) | Critical |
| Warehouse fact naming | All fact tables follow `<entity>_fct` | Critical |
| Warehouse dimension naming | All dimension tables follow `<entity>_dim` | Critical |
| Aggregate naming | Aggregate models follow `<subject>_<grain>` or `<subject>_summary` | Major |
| Integration naming | Integration models follow `int__<subject>__<description>` | Major |
| Surrogate key naming | Surrogate key columns follow `<entity>_pk` pattern | Critical |
| Foreign key naming | Foreign key columns follow `<referenced_entity>_fk` pattern | Major |
| No reserved words | No model or column names use SQL reserved words (e.g. `date`, `order`, `group`) | Major |
| snake_case columns | All column names are `lower_snake_case` | Major |

**Model Completeness Checks**:

| Check | Rule | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| Entity coverage | Every entity from conceptual_model.md appears as at least one warehouse model | Critical |
| Grain defined | Every model (staging and warehouse) has a grain statement | Critical |
| Surrogate key defined | Every model has a surrogate key specified | Critical |
| Source defined | Every staging model references a source table from the pipeline architecture | Critical |
| FK → PK traceability | Every foreign key in a warehouse model references a defined PK in another model | Critical |
| Test coverage | Every model has at minimum: `not_null(pk)` and `unique(pk)` | Critical |
| FK tests | Every foreign key column has a `relationships` test defined | Major |
| Audit column | Every warehouse model includes `dbt_updated_at: current_timestamp()` | Major |
| Materialisation specified | Staging = view, Warehouse = table (or justified exception) | Major |
| Source definitions | `_sources.yml` content is present for each source system | Major |
| Freshness thresholds | Freshness `warn_after` / `error_after` set for each source table with a live feed | Major |

**Physical ERD Checks**:

| Check | Rule | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| ERD present | Section 7 exists and contains a Mermaid `erDiagram` block | Critical |
| All warehouse models in ERD | Every fact, dimension, and aggregate defined in the spec appears as an entity in the ERD | Critical |
| Columns in ERD match spec | Column names in ERD entities match column names defined in the model specs | Critical |
| PK marked | Surrogate key columns are marked `PK` in the ERD | Critical |
| FK marked | Foreign key columns are marked `FK` in the ERD | Critical |
| Relationships match joins | Every FK → PK relationship in the ERD has a corresponding join path defined in the model specs | Critical |
| Relationship labels | All relationship lines have a label (the FK column name) | Major |
| Types specified | All columns have a type (`string`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `date`, `timestamp`) | Major |
| Mermaid syntax valid | No malformed entity definitions, unclosed braces, or syntax errors | Critical |
| No staging in ERD | Staging models are not included in the ERD (warehouse only) unless explicitly justified | Info |

**Cross-System Checks**:

| Check | Rule | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| Cross-system joins documented | Section 6 (Cross-System Join Keys) is present and non-empty if multiple sources are joined | Major |
| Join key types compatible | Left and right join columns have compatible types | Major |

### Step 4: Generate Validation Report

```
## Data Model Validation: [PROJECT_NAME]

**Status**: PASS | FAIL
**Validated**: [date]

### Naming Convention Checks

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Staging naming (stg_source__entity) | ✅/❌ | |
| Fact naming (_fct) | ✅/❌ | |
| Dimension naming (_dim) | ✅/❌ | |
| Surrogate key naming (_pk) | ✅/❌ | |
| Foreign key naming (_fk) | ✅/⚠️ | |
| snake_case columns | ✅/⚠️ | |

### Model Completeness Checks

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Entity coverage | ✅/❌ | [e.g. "Enrolment from conceptual model has no warehouse model"] |
| Grain defined (all models) | ✅/❌ | |
| Surrogate keys defined | ✅/❌ | |
| FK → PK traceability | ✅/❌ | |
| Test coverage (PK) | ✅/❌ | |
| FK relationship tests | ✅/⚠️ | |
| Audit columns | ✅/⚠️ | |
| Materialisations | ✅/⚠️ | |
| Source definitions | ✅/❌ | |
| Freshness thresholds | ✅/⚠️ | |

### Physical ERD Checks

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| ERD present | ✅/❌ | |
| All warehouse models in ERD | ✅/❌ | [e.g. "student_risk_summary missing from ERD"] |
| Columns match spec | ✅/❌ | |
| PK/FK marked correctly | ✅/❌ | |
| Relationships match joins | ✅/❌ | |
| Mermaid syntax valid | ✅/❌ | |

### Cross-System Checks

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Cross-system joins documented | ✅/⚠️ | |
| Join key type compatibility | ✅/⚠️ | |

### Issues Found

[List each Critical and Major issue with location and specific fix instruction]

### Next Steps

[If PASS]:
  /wire:data_model-review <project_id>

[If FAIL]:
  Fix issues in design/data_model_specification.md, then re-run:
  /wire:data_model-validate <project_id>
```

### Step 5: Update Status

```yaml
data_model:
  validate: pass | fail
  validated_date: [today]
```

### Step 6: Sync to Jira (Optional)

Follow the Jira sync workflow in `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`:
- Artifact: `data_model`
- Action: `validate`
- Status: the validate state just written to status.md (pass/fail)

## Edge Cases

### ERD and Spec Inconsistency

If an ERD entity has columns that do not appear in the corresponding model spec (or vice versa), list each discrepancy specifically:
```
❌ ERD entity ATTENDANCE_FCT has column 'session_type' but this column is not defined
   in the attendance_fct model spec in Section 4.
   → Add 'session_type' to the model spec, or remove it from the ERD.
```

### Missing Entity in Warehouse

If a conceptual model entity has no warehouse model, this is a Critical failure — it means that entity cannot be queried in the BI layer. Options to resolve:
1. Add a warehouse model for it
2. Explicitly document it as out of scope in the data model spec (with justification)
3. Flag it as a future phase item

### Provisional Column Names

If staging models contain provisional column names (flagged during data_model:generate because source schema was unavailable), validate will note these as Major warnings rather than failures, since they are acknowledged placeholders.

## Output

- Validation report (displayed to user)
- Updates `.wire/<project_id>/status.md` with validate result and date

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise

## Example
