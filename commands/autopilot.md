# Wire Autopilot — Autonomous Engagement Execution

## Purpose

Wire Autopilot takes a Statement of Work (SOW) and any supporting materials, asks a small set of clarifying questions, then autonomously executes the entire engagement lifecycle — starting with a discovery sprint (problem definition → pitch → release brief → sprint plan) and then executing each downstream delivery release in sequence.

For each release the autopilot generates, validates, and self-reviews every artifact without further human involvement. It produces a complete, demonstrable set of deliverables across all planned releases.

**Safety gates** automatically pause execution before any phase that could affect external systems — activating data connectors, running SQL against databases, or deploying to live environments. At each safety gate, Autopilot presents what it has done so far and asks for explicit confirmation before proceeding.

Autopilot shares the same state files (`status.md`, `autopilot_checkpoint.md`) as the individual commands. A user can switch between Autopilot and manual commands at any point.

## Inputs

**Required**:
- SOW or proposal document path (provided as argument or asked in Phase 1)

**Optional**:
- Additional supporting documents (org charts, call transcripts, architecture diagrams) gathered in Phase 1

---

# Phase 1: Clarifying Questions

Before going autonomous, Autopilot gathers all necessary context upfront. Ask each question in sequence, waiting for the user's response before proceeding.

## Step 1.1: SOW File Path

If a file path was provided as the command argument, verify the file exists using Glob. If found, proceed to Step 1.2.

If no argument was provided or the file was not found, ask directly in chat:

```
Please provide the path to your Statement of Work (SOW) or proposal document.
(e.g., "path/to/SOW.pdf" or "path/to/proposal.docx")
```

Wait for user response. Verify the file exists. If not found, inform the user and ask again.

Once the SOW is located, read it immediately to extract context for subsequent questions.

## Step 1.2: Engagement Details

Ask directly in chat (one question at a time):

```
What is the client name for this engagement?
(e.g., "Acme Corporation", "Client M")
```

Wait for response. Then:

```
What is the engagement name? (used for folder names)
(e.g., "acme_data_platform", "power_digital_analytics")
```

Wait for response. Then:

```
What is your name (engagement lead)?
```

Wait for response. Derive:
- `client_name`: Display name as provided
- `engagement_name`: Lowercase, underscores for spaces, no special chars
- `engagement_lead`: As provided
- `engagement_id`: Today's date as YYYYMMDD

## Step 1.3: Repo Mode

Ask directly in chat:

```
Is this repo the client's code repo, or a dedicated delivery repo?

Option A — Combined: The .wire/ folder lives directly in the client's code repo.
           Simple setup. Default for most engagements.

Option B — Dedicated delivery repo: This repo is exclusively for Wire delivery
           artifacts. The client's code repo is separate.

Which applies? (A/B)
```

Wait for response. If Option B, ask:

```
Please provide the client code repo details:
1. GitHub URL
2. Local path on your machine
3. Default branch (default: main)
```

Store `client_repo_url`, `client_repo_local_path`, `client_repo_branch`.

## Step 1.4: Issue Tracker Integration

Use `AskUserQuestion`:

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "Would you like to track this engagement in an issue tracker?",
    "header": "Issue Tracker",
    "options": [
      {"label": "Jira", "description": "Create or link Jira Epic, Tasks, and Sub-tasks"},
      {"label": "Linear", "description": "Create or link a Linear Project, Issues, and Sub-issues"},
      {"label": "Both Jira and Linear", "description": "Track in both Jira and Linear simultaneously"},
      {"label": "No, skip issue tracking", "description": "Track progress in status.md only"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
}
```

**If Jira or Both selected**, ask:

```
What is the Jira project key? (e.g., DP, ACME, PROJ)
And how would you like to set it up? (create new issues / link to existing)
```

Store `jira_project_key` and `jira_mode` ("create" or "link").

**If Linear or Both selected**, ask (as two separate questions):

First:
```
What is the Linear team identifier? (e.g., ENG, DATA, ACME)
```

Then:
```
How would you like to set up Linear?
  1. Create a new Linear project and new issues — Wire will create a project, issues, and sub-issues from scratch
  2. Use an existing Linear project and create new issues in it — Wire will create fresh issues inside an existing project
  3. Link to existing issues in an existing project — Wire will search the team for matching issues and link them
```

If option 2 or 3 is chosen, ask:
```
Paste the Linear project URL or ID (e.g. https://linear.app/acme/project/my-project-abc123):
```

Store `linear_team_id`, `linear_project_id` (if option 2 or 3 — extract from URL or use as-is), and `linear_mode` ("create", "create_in_existing", or "link").

## Step 1.4.5: Document Store Integration

**Question 1** — Use `AskUserQuestion`:

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "Would you like to replicate generated documents to a client-accessible document store for review and annotation?",
    "header": "Document Store",
    "options": [
      {"label": "Confluence", "description": "Publish documents to a Confluence space — reviewers can comment and annotate inline"},
      {"label": "Notion", "description": "Publish documents to a Notion workspace — reviewers can comment and edit pages"},
      {"label": "Both Confluence and Notion", "description": "Publish to both simultaneously"},
      {"label": "No, skip document store", "description": "Documents stay in GitHub only"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
}
```

**Question 2** — If "Confluence" or "Both Confluence and Notion" was selected, ask directly in chat:
```
What is the Confluence space key where Wire documents should be published?
(e.g. PROJ, ACME, DATA — found in the space URL: /wiki/spaces/PROJ/...)
```

**Question 3** — If "Notion" or "Both Confluence and Notion" was selected, ask directly in chat:
```
What is the Notion parent page for Wire documents?
Paste the page URL or ID (e.g. https://www.notion.so/My-Projects-abc123 or just the ID).
This page must already exist and be accessible via the Notion MCP.
```

Store `docstore_provider` ("confluence", "notion", "both", or null), `confluence_space_key` (if Confluence selected), and `notion_parent_page_id` (if Notion selected — extract ID from URL if a full URL was given).

## Step 1.5: Additional Context

Ask directly in chat:

```
Do you have any other supporting documents I should read? (org charts, call
transcripts, architecture diagrams, existing data model docs)

Provide file paths, or type "no" to skip.
```

Store paths as `supporting_docs`. Read each file that exists.

Also ask:

```
Is there anything else I should know about this engagement? For example:
- Specific technologies or platforms (BigQuery, Snowflake, Looker)
- Naming conventions or standards
- Stakeholder preferences
- Existing codebase or infrastructure

Type "no" to skip.
```

Store as `additional_context`.

## Step 1.6: Confirm, Launch, and Request Permissions

After gathering all inputs, enter plan mode to present the execution plan and pre-authorize shell operations.

1. Call `EnterPlanMode`
2. Write a plan file with the following content:

```markdown
# Wire Autopilot Execution Plan

## Configuration
- **Client**: [client_name]
- **Engagement**: [engagement_name]
- **Lead**: [engagement_lead]
- **SOW**: [sow_path]
- **Supporting docs**: [list or "none"]
- **Jira**: [project_key or "None"]
- **Linear**: [team_id or "None"]
- **Document store**: [provider or "None"]
- **Additional context**: [summary or "none"]

## Execution Sequence

### Phase 2: Engagement Setup
- Create two-tier .wire/ folder structure
- Set up engagement context and copy SOW
- Create 01-discovery release

### Phase 3: Discovery Sprint (autonomous)
1. Problem Definition — generate → validate → self-approve
2. Pitch — generate → validate → self-approve
3. Release Brief — generate → validate → self-approve
4. Sprint Plan — generate → validate → self-approve

### Phase 4: Delivery Releases
(Determined by sprint plan output — typically 2–4 releases)
Each release: create folder → execute full artifact sequence for its type

## What Autopilot Does For Each Artifact
1. **Generate** the artifact from upstream outputs
2. **Validate** against quality criteria (up to 3 retry cycles)
3. **Self-review** for completeness (up to 2 review cycles)
4. Update status tracking

## Safety Gates
These phases will **pause for explicit confirmation** before proceeding:
- **pipeline** — Activates data connectors
- **data_refactor** — Runs dbt against real databases
- **data_quality** — Executes SQL tests against databases
- **deployment** — Deploys to live environments

## Shell Operations Required
- Git (branch creation, commits, push)
- Directory and file management (mkdir, cp)
- dbt commands (compile, run, test, seed, deps)
- File listing and existence checks
- GitHub CLI (create pull request)
```

3. Call `ExitPlanMode` with `allowedPrompts`:

```json
{
  "allowedPrompts": [
    {"tool": "Bash", "prompt": "git operations (checkout, branch, status, add, commit, push, rev-parse, diff)"},
    {"tool": "Bash", "prompt": "create engagement and release directories and copy files (mkdir, cp, mv)"},
    {"tool": "Bash", "prompt": "run dbt commands (compile, run, test, seed, deps, debug, ls)"},
    {"tool": "Bash", "prompt": "run data quality checks and validation scripts"},
    {"tool": "Bash", "prompt": "list files and check file existence (ls, find, wc, cat, head, tail)"},
    {"tool": "Bash", "prompt": "GitHub CLI operations (gh pr create, gh pr view)"}
  ]
}
```

4. If the user approves the plan, proceed to Phase 2.
5. If the user rejects or requests changes, return to Step 1.2 to reconfigure.

**Runtime note**: In Gemini CLI, skip this step and proceed directly to Phase 2. Use appropriate permission flags (e.g., `--yolo`) for autonomous execution.

---

# Phase 2: Engagement Setup

## Step 2.1: Git Branch

1. Run `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` to check the current branch
2. If on `main` or `master`, create and switch to `feature/{engagement_name}`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/{engagement_name}
   ```
3. If branch already exists, switch to it
4. Store `branch_name` for the final summary

## Step 2.2: Create Two-Tier Folder Structure

```bash
mkdir -p .wire/engagement/calls
mkdir -p .wire/engagement/org
mkdir -p .wire/research/sessions
mkdir -p .wire/releases/01-discovery/planning
mkdir -p .wire/releases/01-discovery/artifacts
touch .wire/engagement/calls/.gitkeep
touch .wire/engagement/org/.gitkeep
touch .wire/research/sessions/.gitkeep
touch .wire/releases/01-discovery/artifacts/.gitkeep
```

## Step 2.3: Copy SOW and Supporting Docs

```bash
cp {sow_path} .wire/engagement/sow.md   # or sow.pdf if PDF
```

If `supporting_docs` were provided, copy each to `engagement/`:
```bash
cp {doc_path} .wire/engagement/
```

## Step 2.4: Create Engagement Context File

Read `TEMPLATES/engagement-context-template.md` and populate:
- `{{ENGAGEMENT_NAME}}` → engagement_name
- `{{CLIENT_NAME}}` → client_name
- `{{CREATED_DATE}}` → today's date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `{{ENGAGEMENT_LEAD}}` → engagement_lead
- `{{REPO_MODE}}` → `combined` or `dedicated_delivery`

If dedicated_delivery, populate the client_repo section. Write to `.wire/engagement/context.md`.

## Step 2.5: Create Discovery Release Status File

Read `TEMPLATES/discovery-status-template.md` and populate:
- `{{RELEASE_ID}}` → engagement_id (YYYYMMDD)
- `{{RELEASE_NAME}}` → `01-discovery`
- `{{CLIENT_NAME}}` → client_name
- `{{ENGAGEMENT_NAME}}` → engagement_name
- `{{CREATED_DATE}}` → today's date

Write to `.wire/releases/01-discovery/status.md`.

## Step 2.6: Issue Tracker Setup (if opted in)

**If Jira or Both selected**: Follow the workflow in `specs/utils/jira_create.md`. Pass `release_type: discovery` and artifact scope (problem_definition, pitch, release_brief, sprint_plan). If Jira fails, note the failure and continue.

**If Linear or Both selected**: Follow the workflow in `specs/utils/linear_create.md`. Pass `release_type: discovery` and the same artifact scope. If Linear fails, note the failure and continue.

When Both is selected, run both workflows independently — one failure does not block the other.

## Step 2.6.5: Document Store Setup (if opted in)

If `docstore_provider` is set, follow the workflow in `specs/utils/docstore_setup.md`. Pass the engagement name, `releases/01-discovery` as the release folder, and `docstore_provider`. If setup fails, note the failure and continue — document store is optional and additive.

## Step 2.7: Initialize Autopilot Checkpoint

Create `.wire/autopilot_checkpoint.md`:

```markdown
# Autopilot Checkpoint

## Configuration
- Engagement: [engagement_name]
- Client: [client_name]
- Lead: [engagement_lead]
- SOW: [sow_filename]
- Jira: [project_key or "None"]
- Linear: [team_id or "None"]
- Document store: [provider or "None"]
- Branch: [branch_name]

## SOW Summary
[Condensed 500-word summary covering: business context, deliverables, data sources, key stakeholders, timeline, and technology preferences]

## Engagement Structure
- Discovery release: .wire/releases/01-discovery/
- Delivery releases: (to be determined by sprint plan)

## Completed Phases

## Current Phase
engagement_setup: complete

## Key Context
- Data sources: [list from SOW]

---
```

---

# Phase 3: Discovery Sprint (Autonomous)

The discovery sprint runs the full Shape Up planning cycle autonomously. All four artifacts are generated, validated, and self-approved without human intervention. Autopilot makes all planning decisions from the SOW and supporting material.

## Step 3.1: Problem Definition

**Inputs**: `.wire/engagement/sow.md`, `.wire/engagement/context.md`, supporting docs
**Output**: `.wire/releases/01-discovery/planning/problem_definition.md`

**Autonomous generation process**:

1. Read all engagement context (SOW, context.md, supporting docs, additional_context)
2. Extract answers to the seven problem-framing questions directly from the source material:
   - **Who has the problem**: Identify the primary stakeholder role(s) from the SOW
   - **What they're trying to do**: Extract the job-to-be-done (not the solution)
   - **What's in the way**: Extract the friction, gap, or current-state pain points
   - **Current workarounds**: Infer from SOW's "as-is" description or context
   - **What "solved" looks like**: Extract desired outcomes and success criteria
   - **Constraints**: Extract budget ceiling, timeline, technology constraints, compliance
   - **Previously ruled out**: Extract any exclusions, assumptions, or "out of scope" clauses
3. Generate the full 10-section problem_definition document following the structure in `specs/discovery/problem_definition/generate.md`
4. Where information is genuinely absent from source material, write "[To confirm with client]" — do not fabricate

**Validate**:
- [ ] All 10 sections populated (sections with no source data marked "[To confirm]")
- [ ] Constraints section has budget/timeline/technology entries
- [ ] "What solved looks like" is outcome-oriented (not solution-prescribing)
- [ ] Impact table completed with current vs desired state

**Self-approve** if all validate checks pass. Update status.md:
```yaml
problem_definition:
  generate: "complete"
  validate: "pass"
  review: "approved"
  reviewed_by: "Wire Autopilot (self-review)"
  reviewed_date: [today]
  file: "planning/problem_definition.md"
```

**Self-review criteria**:
1. Problem is framed without prescribing a solution
2. Stakeholders are specific (not "the business" or "users")
3. SOW deliverables trace to the problem statement
4. Constraints are concrete, not abstract

**Document store sync**: If `docstore_provider` is set, follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md` to publish `planning/problem_definition.md` to the configured store. Fail gracefully — do not block if the sync fails.

Report:
```
--- Discovery: Problem Definition ---
Status: approved (self-reviewed)
File: .wire/releases/01-discovery/planning/problem_definition.md
---
```

## Step 3.2: Pitch

**Input**: `planning/problem_definition.md`
**Output**: `planning/pitch.md`

**Autonomous generation process**:

Generate the 10-section Shape Up pitch. Make all shaping decisions autonomously from the source material:

1. **Appetite**: Infer from SOW timeline —
   - 6+ weeks stated duration → Big batch (6 weeks)
   - 2–3 weeks → Small batch (1–2 weeks)
   - Ambiguous → Default to Big batch
2. **Problem statement**: Condense from problem_definition Section 3
3. **Appetite statement**: State the time budget and what that means for scope
4. **Solution**: Shape the core solution element — the one thing that, if done, solves the problem. Base on SOW deliverables. Use fat-marker description (rough but solved). Document trade-offs and autonomous decisions.
5. **Rabbit holes**: Identify 3–5 specific things to avoid based on SOW scope boundaries and constraints
6. **No-gos**: Extract explicitly out-of-scope items from SOW
7. **Open questions**: List 3–5 questions that need client confirmation before delivery starts
8. **Downstream releases**: Based on SOW deliverables and appetite, propose delivery release types:
   - Map each SOW deliverable category to the appropriate release type
   - Order releases logically (data-first before dashboards, etc.)
   - Assign a name and type to each (e.g., `02-data-foundation: pipeline_only`, `03-reporting: dashboard_extension`)
9. **Betting table case**: 2–3 bullet points making the case for proceeding
10. **Metrics for success**: Extract from SOW acceptance criteria or success criteria

Generate the pitch document following the full structure in `specs/discovery/pitch/generate.md`.

**Validate**:
- [ ] All 10 pitch sections populated
- [ ] Appetite defined (small/big batch)
- [ ] At least one downstream release identified in Section 8
- [ ] Rabbit holes list has at least 3 items
- [ ] No-gos list populated from SOW out-of-scope

**Self-approve** if validate passes. Update status.md:
```yaml
pitch:
  generate: "complete"
  validate: "pass"
  review: "approved"
  reviewed_by: "Wire Autopilot (self-review)"
  reviewed_date: [today]
  file: "planning/pitch.md"
```

**Self-review criteria**:
1. Solution is shaped — rough but solved, not open-ended
2. Appetite is fixed — not adjusted to fit the solution
3. Downstream releases are typed and named
4. Rabbit holes are concrete things (not abstract risks)

**Document store sync**: If `docstore_provider` is set, follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md` to publish `planning/pitch.md` to the configured store. Fail gracefully — do not block if the sync fails.

Report:
```
--- Discovery: Pitch ---
Status: approved (self-reviewed)
Downstream releases identified: [list]
File: .wire/releases/01-discovery/planning/pitch.md
---
```

## Step 3.3: Release Brief

**Input**: `planning/pitch.md`, `engagement/context.md`, `engagement/sow.md`
**Output**: `planning/release_brief.md`

**Autonomous generation process**:

Generate the formal 12-section release brief following the structure in `specs/discovery/release_brief/generate.md`. Make all content decisions from the pitch and SOW:

1. Extract deliverables from pitch Sections 3 (solution) and 8 (downstream releases)
2. Define acceptance criteria from SOW success criteria and pitch metrics
3. Extract budget from SOW contract terms
4. Populate downstream releases table from pitch Section 8 — this is the authoritative list of delivery releases to spawn
5. Mark sign-off block as "[Signature required before sprint plan]"

**Validate**:
- [ ] Deliverables table has at least one row with acceptance criteria
- [ ] Downstream releases table populated from pitch Section 8
- [ ] Timeline section populated (even if "TBD — to confirm with client")
- [ ] Out-of-scope section matches pitch no-gos

**Self-approve** if validate passes. Update status.md:
```yaml
release_brief:
  generate: "complete"
  validate: "pass"
  review: "approved"
  reviewed_by: "Wire Autopilot (self-review)"
  reviewed_date: [today]
  file: "planning/release_brief.md"
```

**Document store sync**: If `docstore_provider` is set, follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md` to publish `planning/release_brief.md` to the configured store. Fail gracefully — do not block if the sync fails.

Report:
```
--- Discovery: Release Brief ---
Status: approved (self-reviewed)
Delivery releases planned: [list from Section 4]
File: .wire/releases/01-discovery/planning/release_brief.md
---
```

## Step 3.4: Sprint Plan

**Input**: `planning/release_brief.md`, `planning/pitch.md`
**Output**: `planning/sprint_plan.md`

**Autonomous generation process**:

Generate the sprint plan following `specs/discovery/sprint_plan/generate.md`. Make all planning decisions autonomously:

1. Determine sprint length from appetite (small batch → 1 sprint, big batch → 3–5 sprints of ~1 week)
2. For each deliverable in the release brief, generate epics
3. For each epic, generate stories with Fibonacci point estimates (1/2/3/5/8 — no 13-point stories)
4. Assign each story to a sprint
5. Include a "Downstream Releases" table at the end — this is the canonical list of delivery releases that Phase 4 will execute:

   | Release Name | Type | Scope Summary | Priority |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | [e.g. 02-data-foundation] | [e.g. pipeline_only] | [1-line scope] | 1 |

**Velocity assumption**: 5 points per consultant day. Include buffer of 20%.

**Validate**:
- [ ] All release_brief deliverables have epics
- [ ] No story exceeds 8 points
- [ ] Point totals add up correctly
- [ ] Downstream Releases table has at least one row with name and type
- [ ] Every release type in the table is a valid Wire release type: full_platform, pipeline_only, dbt_development, dashboard_extension, dashboard_first, enablement, platform_migration, agentic_data_stack

**Self-approve** if validate passes. Update status.md:
```yaml
sprint_plan:
  generate: "complete"
  validate: "pass"
  review: "approved"
  reviewed_by: "Wire Autopilot (self-review)"
  reviewed_date: [today]
  file: "planning/sprint_plan.md"
```

**Document store sync**: If `docstore_provider` is set, follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md` to publish `planning/sprint_plan.md` to the configured store. Fail gracefully — do not block if the sync fails.

Report:
```
--- Discovery: Sprint Plan ---
Status: approved (self-reviewed)
Total: [X] points across [N] sprints
Downstream releases to execute:
  [list with name and type]
File: .wire/releases/01-discovery/planning/sprint_plan.md
---
```

## Step 3.5: Parse Downstream Releases

Read the "Downstream Releases" table from `.wire/releases/01-discovery/planning/sprint_plan.md`.

For each row, extract:
- `release_name`: the folder name (e.g., `02-data-foundation`)
- `release_type`: the Wire release type (e.g., `pipeline_only`)
- `scope_summary`: the one-line scope description

Store as an ordered list: `planned_releases = [{"name": ..., "type": ..., "scope": ...}, ...]`

Update autopilot_checkpoint.md:
```markdown
## Delivery Releases to Execute
| Release | Type | Scope |
|---------|------|-------|
| [name] | [type] | [scope] |
```

---

# Phase 4: Delivery Release Execution

For each release in `planned_releases`, in order:

## Step 4.0: Confirm Release Plan with User

Before spawning and executing releases, present the plan and confirm:

Use `AskUserQuestion`:

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "Discovery sprint complete. Ready to execute [N] delivery releases:\n[list each release with name and type]\n\nProceed with autonomous execution?",
    "header": "Discovery Complete — Proceed to Delivery?",
    "options": [
      {"label": "Yes, execute all releases", "description": "Proceed autonomously through all planned delivery releases"},
      {"label": "Review discovery artifacts first", "description": "Pause here — I'll review the discovery output before proceeding"},
      {"label": "Stop here", "description": "End Autopilot — I will run delivery releases manually using /wire:session:start"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
}
```

- **Yes, execute all**: Proceed to Step 4.1
- **Review first**: Output paths to all discovery artifacts and wait for user to say "continue"
- **Stop here**: Jump to Phase 5 (commit + push) and Phase 6 (final summary)

## Step 4.1: For Each Delivery Release

Repeat steps 4.2–4.6 for each release in `planned_releases`.

Set `current_release` = the current release name (e.g., `02-data-foundation`).
Set `current_type` = the current release type (e.g., `pipeline_only`).

### Step 4.2: Create Release Folder (Spawn)

```bash
mkdir -p .wire/releases/{current_release}/{artifacts,requirements,design,dev,test,deploy,enablement}
touch .wire/releases/{current_release}/requirements/.gitkeep
touch .wire/releases/{current_release}/design/.gitkeep
touch .wire/releases/{current_release}/dev/.gitkeep
touch .wire/releases/{current_release}/test/.gitkeep
touch .wire/releases/{current_release}/deploy/.gitkeep
touch .wire/releases/{current_release}/enablement/.gitkeep
```

Create the status file by reading `TEMPLATES/status-template.md` and populating:
- `{{PROJECT_ID}}` → engagement_id
- `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` → engagement_name
- `{{PROJECT_TYPE}}` → current_type
- `{{CLIENT_NAME}}` → client_name
- `{{CREATED_DATE}}` → today's date

Set artifact scope based on `current_type` (see Artifact Scope Reference at the end of this spec).

Write to `.wire/releases/{current_release}/status.md`.

Initialize release checkpoint block in autopilot_checkpoint.md:
```markdown
## Release: {current_release} ({current_type})
Status: in_progress
Started: [timestamp]
```

Output:
```
--- Starting Release: {current_release} ({current_type}) ---
Artifact sequence: [ordered list for this type]
---
```

### Step 4.3: Run the Artifact Execution Loop

Execute the artifact sequence for `current_type`. All artifact paths use `.wire/releases/{current_release}/` as the release root. In the Per-Artifact Execution Blocks below, `{folder_name}` means `releases/{current_release}`.

**Artifact sequences by release type**:

**full_platform**: requirements → workshops → conceptual_model → pipeline_design → data_model → mockups → pipeline → dbt → semantic_layer → dashboards → data_quality → uat → deployment → training → documentation

**pipeline_only**: requirements → pipeline_design → pipeline → data_quality → deployment

**dbt_development**: requirements → data_model → dbt → semantic_layer → data_quality → deployment

**dashboard_extension**: requirements → mockups → dashboards → training

**dashboard_first**: requirements → mockups → viz_catalog → data_model → seed_data → dbt → semantic_layer → dashboards → data_refactor → data_quality → uat → deployment → training → documentation

**enablement**: training → documentation

**platform_migration**: ingestion_audit → db_object_audit → security_audit → dbt_audit → orchestration_audit → migration_inventory → migration_strategy → target_setup → ingestion_migration → dbt_migration → orchestration_migration → equivalency_validation → cutover → migration_report

**agentic_data_stack**: dataset_audit → metric_audit → query_audit → governance_design → semantic_layer_design → canonical_models → semantic_layer → knowledge_skill → agent_config → eval_suite → adversarial_config → launch_gate → enablement

Note: `agentic_data_stack` autopilot pauses at `launch_gate` for human review of per-domain accuracy results. Only cleared domains proceed to enablement — blocked domains require a manual fix cycle before Autopilot can continue.

For each artifact in the sequence, execute the Execution Loop (see Execution Loop section):

1. **Check status**: Read `.wire/releases/{current_release}/status.md`. If this artifact's generate state is already `complete` and review state is `approved`, skip it.

2. **Safety gate check**: If this artifact is in the safety-gated list (`pipeline`, `data_refactor`, `data_quality`, `deployment`; and for `platform_migration` releases: `target_setup`, `ingestion_migration`, `orchestration_migration`, `cutover`), execute the Safety Gate protocol before proceeding.

3. **Generate**: Execute the generate logic for this artifact (see Per-Artifact Blocks below).
   - Update status.md: set `generate: complete`, `generated_date: [today]`
   - Log to `.wire/releases/{current_release}/execution_log.md`
   - **Jira sync**: If Jira is configured, sync — artifact=[artifact_name], action=generate, status=complete
   - **Linear sync**: If Linear is configured, sync — same artifact and action
   - **Document store sync**: If `docstore_provider` is set, follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md` to publish the generated artifact file. Fail gracefully — do not block.

4. **Validate**: Execute validation checks.
   - Pass → Update status.md: `validate: pass`
   - Fail → Re-generate (max 3 cycles); if still failing after 3 cycles, set `validate: fail`, log as blocked
   - Log to execution_log.md
   - **Jira sync**: sync validate result
   - **Linear sync**: If Linear is configured, sync validate result

5. **Self-Review**: Execute self-review criteria.
   - Approved → Update status.md: `review: approved`, `reviewed_by: "Wire Autopilot (self-review)"`
   - Issues found → Re-generate and re-validate (max 2 review cycles)
   - Still failing → set `review: changes_requested`, log as blocked
   - **Jira sync**: sync review result
   - **Linear sync**: If Linear is configured, sync review result
   - **Document store sync**: If approved and `docstore_provider` is set, re-sync the artifact to the store to reflect any revisions made during review cycles. Fail gracefully.

6. **Update checkpoint**: Move artifact to "Completed Phases" in autopilot_checkpoint.md with brief summary and any key context discovered.

7. **Report progress**:
   ```
   --- Artifact Complete: [artifact_name] ([current_release]) ---
   Status: [approved/blocked]
   Files: [list]
   Progress: [N/total] artifacts in this release, [R/total_releases] releases done
   ---
   ```

8. **Telemetry**: Fire-and-forget:
   ```bash
   if [ "${WIRE_TELEMETRY:-true}" != "false" ]; then WIRE_UID=$(cat ~/.wire/telemetry_id 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown") && curl -s -X POST https://api.segment.io/v1/track -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"writeKey\":\"DxXwrT6ucDMRmouCsYDwthdChwDLsNYL\",\"userId\":\"$WIRE_UID\",\"event\":\"wire_command\",\"properties\":{\"command\":\"ARTIFACT_NAME-generate\",\"timestamp\":\"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\",\"git_repo\":\"$(git config --get remote.origin.url 2>/dev/null || echo unknown)\",\"git_branch\":\"$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo unknown)\",\"username\":\"$(whoami)\",\"hostname\":\"$(hostname)\",\"plugin_version\":\"3.4.0\",\"os\":\"$(uname -s)\",\"runtime\":\"claude\",\"autopilot\":\"true\",\"autopilot_release\":\"{current_release}\",\"autopilot_artifact\":\"ARTIFACT_NAME\"}}" > /dev/null 2>&1 & fi
   ```
   Replace `ARTIFACT_NAME` with the actual artifact name. Do not wait for the result.

### Step 4.4: Release Resumption Protocol

If Autopilot is invoked and a release in progress already has artifacts completed:

1. Read `.wire/releases/{current_release}/status.md` to identify completed phases
2. Identify the first incomplete artifact in the sequence
3. Resume from that point — do NOT re-generate already-approved artifacts

### Step 4.5: Commit After Each Release

After all artifacts in a release are processed:

```bash
git add .wire/releases/{current_release}/ dbt/ 2>/dev/null; git add -u; true
```

Check for staged changes. If changes exist:

```bash
git commit -m "Wire Autopilot: {engagement_name} — {current_release} ({current_type}) complete

Client: {client_name}
Release: {current_release}
Type: {current_type}
Artifacts: {comma-separated list of completed artifacts}"
```

Update autopilot_checkpoint.md:
```markdown
## Release: {current_release} ({current_type})
Status: complete
Committed: [commit hash]
```

Output:
```
--- Release Complete: {current_release} ---
Type: {current_type}
Committed: [hash]
[R/total_releases] releases done. Moving to next release...
---
```

---

## Safety Gates

Certain artifacts can touch external systems. Before processing any of these, Autopilot **must pause** and request explicit user confirmation.

**Safety-gated artifacts:**

| Artifact | Risk | Warning |
|----------|------|---------|
| `pipeline` | Activates real data connectors (Fivetran, Airbyte) that begin replicating from production sources | "This phase will generate pipeline configuration. When activated, this could start replicating data from your production source systems. Please confirm the target environment and connector credentials are correct before proceeding." |
| `data_refactor` | Modifies dbt source definitions to point to real client data | "This phase will switch dbt models from seed data to real client data sources. The validate step will run `dbt compile` and potentially `dbt run` against your database. Please confirm the database connection is pointing to the correct (non-production) environment." |
| `data_quality` | Runs SQL-based tests against the database | "This phase will run data quality tests that execute SQL queries against your database. Please confirm the target database connection is correct." |
| `deployment` | Creates and potentially executes deployment scripts against live environments | "This phase will generate deployment runbooks and scripts. Executing these would deploy changes to a live environment. Please confirm you are ready to proceed with deployment planning." |

**Safety gate behavior** — when the execution loop reaches a safety-gated artifact, it MUST:

1. Pause execution
2. Present a summary of all completed work so far (from the checkpoint)
3. Display the risk-specific warning message
4. Use `AskUserQuestion`:

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "[Warning message for this artifact]. How would you like to proceed?",
    "header": "Safety Gate — [artifact_name] in [current_release]",
    "options": [
      {"label": "Proceed", "description": "Continue — I have verified the target environment"},
      {"label": "Review first", "description": "Show me all generated artifacts so far, then I'll decide"},
      {"label": "Stop here", "description": "End Autopilot — I will continue manually from this point"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
}
```

- **Proceed**: Continue with the artifact's generate/validate/review cycle
- **Review first**: Output a summary of all files generated so far with their paths, then wait for the user to say "continue"
- **Stop here**: Commit progress, output final summary (Phase 6), and exit

---

# Phase 5: Final Commit, Push, and Pull Request

After all releases are processed (or when Autopilot stops):

## Step 5.1: Final Commit

Stage any uncommitted changes:
```bash
git add .wire/ dbt/ 2>/dev/null; git add -u; true
```

Check for staged changes. If any:
```bash
git commit -m "Wire Autopilot: {engagement_name} — engagement complete

Client: {client_name}
Releases: {comma-separated list of release names}
Branch: {branch_name}"
```

## Step 5.2: Git Push

```bash
git push -u origin {branch_name}
```

If push fails (no remote configured), log: "Note: Could not push to remote. Commits are saved locally." and skip PR creation.

## Step 5.3: Create Pull Request

Check `gh` CLI is available:
```bash
which gh
```

If not available, log: "Note: GitHub CLI (gh) not found. Please create a PR manually for branch {branch_name}." and skip to Phase 6.

Create the PR:
```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "Wire: {client_name} — {engagement_name}" \
  --body "## Summary

# Per-Artifact Execution Blocks

Each block describes the generate, validate, and self-review logic for one artifact type.

In all path references below, `{folder_name}` means `releases/{current_release}` — the currently executing delivery release folder.

---

## ARTIFACT: requirements

### Generate

**Input**: SOW/documents in `.wire/{folder_name}/artifacts/`, `engagement/sow.md`, `engagement/context.md`
**Output**: `.wire/{folder_name}/requirements/requirements_specification.md`

**Process**:
1. Read all documents in `engagement/` and the release's `artifacts/` folder
2. Read the approved discovery artifacts: `releases/01-discovery/planning/release_brief.md`, `releases/01-discovery/planning/sprint_plan.md`
3. Extract and structure into a requirements specification with these sections:
   - **Executive Summary**: 2–3 paragraph overview
   - **Business Context**: Client background, problem statement, strategic goals, success criteria (from problem_definition)
   - **Stakeholders**: Table with name, role, department, involvement level
   - **Functional Requirements**: Numbered list (FR-001, FR-002, etc.) with description and acceptance criteria
   - **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, availability, scalability
   - **Data Requirements**: Source systems table (name, type, owner, volume, refresh frequency)
   - **Technical Requirements**: Platform, tools, environments, constraints
   - **Deliverables**: Table mapping SOW deliverables to Wire artifacts with acceptance criteria
   - **Timeline**: Milestones with dates (from sprint plan where available)
   - **Assumptions and Dependencies**
   - **Risks and Mitigations**: Table with risk, impact, likelihood, mitigation
   - **Scope Management**: In-scope, out-of-scope, change process (from discovery no-gos)
4. Write to `.wire/{folder_name}/requirements/requirements_specification.md`

- [ ] All SOW deliverables documented
- [ ] Each deliverable has clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] Timeline with milestones
- [ ] Stakeholder roles defined
- [ ] Out-of-scope items documented
- [ ] Dependencies and assumptions documented

### Self-Review

**Criteria**:
1. **SOW Traceability**: Every deliverable in the SOW maps to at least one requirement
2. **Discovery Alignment**: Requirements are consistent with the problem_definition and pitch
3. **No Fabrication**: All requirements are traceable to the SOW or discovery artifacts — nothing invented
4. **Clarity**: Each functional requirement has testable acceptance criteria
5. **Consistency**: Requirements do not contradict each other

**Process**:
1. Parse requirements for `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers, TBD items, ambiguities
2. Categorize by topic: requirements, data, technical, timeline, scope
3. Generate workshop agenda with parts: requirements clarification (45 min), data source details (30 min), technical approach (30 min), wrap-up (15 min)
4. Create decision matrix template: topic, options, decision, rationale, owner

### Validate

No specific validation checks.

### Self-Review

**Criteria**:
1. All ambiguities from requirements are addressed in workshop topics
2. Workshop agenda covers all TBD items
3. Decision matrix includes all open questions
4. **Autopilot Decision**: Since no actual workshop is conducted, auto-approve the workshop materials as reference documentation. Mark as `review: approved` with note: "Workshop materials generated as reference — no workshop conducted in Autopilot mode"

## ARTIFACT: conceptual_model

### Generate

**Input**: `.wire/{folder_name}/requirements/requirements_specification.md`, engagement artifacts for source schemas
**Output**: `.wire/{folder_name}/design/conceptual_model.md`

**Process**:
1. Extract business entities from requirements: nouns, deliverables, reporting subjects
2. For each entity: name (PascalCase), description, key attributes (3–6), approximate volume
3. Define relationships with verb phrases and cardinality
4. Generate Mermaid erDiagram (entity-only, no column definitions)
5. Include relationship narratives explaining business meaning
6. Section for entities out of scope
7. Section for open questions

### Validate

3. Define replication strategy per source (full refresh, incremental, CDC, API, batch)
4. Specify pipeline architecture: landing/raw naming, staging layer (`stg_<source>__<entity>`), warehouse layer, error handling, scheduling
5. Generate Mermaid Data Flow Diagram: sources → ingestion → staging → warehouse → BI
6. Document design decisions with rationale
7. Include technology stack table and security/governance section
8. **Autonomous Decision**: Choose the most practical replication strategy based on SOW constraints and document the rationale

### Validate

**Checks**:
- [ ] Every source system from requirements appears in source analysis

**Process**:
1. Define source definitions with freshness thresholds
2. Design staging models: `stg_<source>__<entity>`, view materialization, surrogate key composition, column renames, derived columns, tests
3. Design integration models: `int__<subject>__<description>`, ephemeral/view, for cross-system joins
4. Design warehouse models:
   - Fact tables: `<entity>_fct`, grain, surrogate key, foreign keys, measures
   - Dimension tables: `<entity>_dim`, SCD Type 1 or 2
   - Aggregates: `<subject>_<grain>`, pre-aggregated measures
5. Specify seed files for configurable business logic
6. Generate physical ERD as Mermaid erDiagram with all warehouse models, columns, PKs, FKs
7. Document cross-system join keys
8. Define dbt test coverage plan

## ARTIFACT: dbt

### Generate

**Input**: `.wire/{folder_name}/design/data_model_specification.md`, dbt conventions (if found)
**Output**: dbt models in the repository's `dbt/` directory (NOT inside `.wire/`). The only dbt-related output inside the release folder is `.wire/{folder_name}/dev/dbt_models_summary.md`.

**Process**:
1. Check for project-specific dbt conventions file
2. Determine dbt project location: check if `dbt/` exists in the repository root. If yes, use it. If not, create it.
3. Generate staging models in `dbt/models/staging/<source_system>/`:
   - `stg_<source>__<entity>.sql` — source() calls, surrogate keys, renames, filters
   - `_sources.yml` per source system with freshness
   - `stg_<source_system>.yml` — model docs and tests
   - Materialized as view
4. Generate integration models in `dbt/models/integration/`:
   - `int__<entity>.sql` — one per entity, consolidating staging inputs
   - `int__<entity>__<description>.sql` — optional intermediate models
   - **Always create integration models**, even if simple pass-throughs
5. Generate warehouse models in `dbt/models/warehouse/core/`:
   - `<entity>_dim.sql` — dimensions with SCD handling
   - `<entity>_fct.sql` — facts with measures, FKs
   - `<entity>_agg.sql` — pre-aggregated tables if needed
   - Table materialization
6. Generate schema.yml files with model descriptions, column descriptions, and tests
7. Generate `dbt/dbt_project.yml` if new project
8. **For dashboard_first with seed data**: Generate seed-based source definitions using `ref('seed_name')` instead of `source()` in staging models
9. Create `.wire/{folder_name}/dev/dbt_models_summary.md` with model counts, test coverage, and directory listing

**SQL Standards**:
- 4-space indentation, max 80 char lines
- All CTEs from refs/sources prefixed with `s_`
- Final CTE always named `final`, ending with `select * from final`
- Lowercase field names and functions
- Explicit join types (inner join, left join)
- Field ordering: keys, dates, attributes, metrics, metadata

# Engagement-Level Resumption Protocol

If Autopilot is invoked on an engagement that already has work in progress:

1. Check whether `.wire/engagement/context.md` exists — if not, treat as a fresh engagement
2. Check `.wire/autopilot_checkpoint.md` for compressed context from prior phases
3. Check `.wire/releases/01-discovery/status.md` — if all four discovery artifacts are approved, skip Phase 3
4. Check `planned_releases` from the checkpoint — identify which releases are complete and which are in progress
5. Resume execution from the first incomplete artifact in the first incomplete release
6. Do NOT re-generate already-completed and approved artifacts

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise

## Example

```markdown
