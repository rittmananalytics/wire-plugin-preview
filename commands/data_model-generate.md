# Design dbt model structure

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command

## Workflow Specification

description: Generate dbt data model specification and physical ERD
argument-hint: <project-folder>
---

# Data Model Generate Command

Follow `specs/utils/data_designer_delegate.md` before executing the workflow below.

## Purpose

Generate the full dbt-layer data model specification — covering staging, integration, and warehouse layers — together with a **Physical Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** as a Mermaid erDiagram showing every model with its columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships. This is the primary input for dbt code generation.

The data model specification narrows the LLM's generation space for the dbt phase: every model name, column name, join path, surrogate key composition, and test definition is determined here, not during code generation.

## Usage

```bash
/wire:data_model-generate YYYYMMDD_project_name
```

## Prerequisites

**Default** (all project types except `dashboard_first`):
- `requirements`: `review: approved`
- `conceptual_model`: `review: approved` — provides the entity framework
- `pipeline_design`: `review: approved` — provides source table names and replication details

**Dashboard-first** (`dashboard_first` project type):
- `requirements`: `review: approved`
- `viz_catalog`: `generate: complete` — provides the measures, dimensions, and dashboard structure

## Workflow

### Step 1: Verify Prerequisites and Read Inputs

1. Read `.wire/<project_id>/status.md`
2. Read `project_type` from frontmatter
3. **If `dashboard_first`**:
   - Verify `requirements.review` is `approved` and `viz_catalog.generate` is `complete`
   - Read the following in order:
     - `requirements/requirements_specification.md`
     - `design/visualization_catalog.md` (measures, dimensions, dashboard structure)
     - `design/dashboard_spec.md` (dashboard purpose and layout)
   - Also read `artifacts/` for SOW and domain context
4. **Otherwise (default)**:
   - Verify all three default prerequisites are met. For each that is not:
     ```
     Error: [artifact] must be approved before data model generation.
     Run: /wire:[artifact]:review <project_id>
     ```
   - Read the following in order:
     - `requirements/requirements_specification.md`
     - `design/conceptual_model.md` (entities, relationships)
     - `design/pipeline_architecture.md` (source tables, staging model names)
4. Use Glob to find all files in `.wire/<project_id>/artifacts/**/*`
5. Read any source schema examples, existing dbt models, or SQL files in `artifacts/`

### Step 2: Define Source Definitions

For each source system in the pipeline design, produce a complete dbt `_sources.yml` specification:

```yaml
version: 2

sources:
  - name: <source_system>
    database: <bigquery_project>
    schema: <dataset_name>
    freshness:
      warn_after: {count: <N>, period: hour}
      error_after: {count: <N>, period: hour}
    tables:
      - name: <table_name>
        description: "<Table description>"
        loaded_at_field: <timestamp_column>
        columns:
          - name: <column_name>
            description: "<Column description>"
            tests:
              - not_null
              - unique   # only on PK columns
```

Freshness thresholds must be calibrated to the replication cadence from the pipeline design:
- Real-time / CDC sources: `warn_after: 30 minutes`, `error_after: 60 minutes`
- Daily batch sources: `warn_after: 25 hours`, `error_after: 49 hours`
- Manual/on-demand: no freshness check

Note any columns that are excluded for data governance reasons (e.g. free-text fields excluded for safeguarding). Document exclusions explicitly.

### Step 3: Define Staging Models

For each source table, define the staging model:

**Naming**: `stg_<source_system>__<entity_name>` (double underscore between source and entity)

**Materialisation**: `view`

**Tags**: `['staging', '<source_system>']`

For each staging model, specify:
- **Grain**: One row per what? (e.g. "one row per daily attendance mark per student per session")
- **Surrogate key**: `dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(['<id_columns>'])` → `<entity>_pk`
- **Column renames**: Source column name → standard column name (snake_case, business-meaningful)
- **Derived columns**: Any simple transformations applied at staging (e.g. `is_present = mark_code IN ('/', 'L')`)
- **Exclusions**: Any source columns excluded and why
- **Filters**: Any `WHERE` clause applied (e.g. `WHERE _fivetran_deleted = false`)
- **Tests**: `not_null` and `unique` on `<entity>_pk`; `not_null` on any non-nullable business keys

Use this template format:

```
### stg_<source>__<entity>
**Source**: `<source_system>.<table_name>`
**Grain**: One row per [description]
**Surrogate key**: `generate_surrogate_key(['<col1>', '<col2>'])` → `<entity>_pk`

| Source column | Staged column | Type | Notes |
|--------------|---------------|------|-------|
| <SourceCol> | <staged_name> | string/date/int/bool | |
| <SourceCol> | <staged_name> | timestamp | Renamed from Fivetran audit column |

**Derived columns**:
- `<derived_col>`: `<expression>`

**Filters**: `WHERE <condition>`

**Tests**: `not_null(entity_pk)`, `unique(entity_pk)`, `not_null(<business_key>)`
```

### Step 4: Define Integration Models (if applicable)

For complex transformations that span multiple staging models but are not yet warehouse-level:

**Naming**: `int__<subject>__<description>` (e.g. `int__student__risk_signals`)

**Materialisation**: `view` (or `ephemeral` for simple pass-throughs)

Use integration models for:
- Cross-system joins (e.g. joining ProSolution student IDs to Focus student IDs)
- Business logic that derives flags or categorisations
- Pre-aggregations that feed multiple warehouse models

### Step 5: Define Warehouse Models

For each fact table, dimension table, and aggregate:

**Fact table naming**: `<entity>_fct` (e.g. `attendance_fct`, `pastoral_notes_fct`)
**Dimension table naming**: `<entity>_dim` (e.g. `student_dim`, `course_dim`)
**Aggregate naming**: `<subject>_<grain>` (e.g. `student_risk_summary`, `daily_attendance_summary`)

**Materialisation**: `table`

**Tags**: `['warehouse', 'fact']` or `['warehouse', 'dimension']`

For each warehouse model specify:
- **Grain**: One row per what?
- **Surrogate key**: composition and name (e.g. `attendance_pk`)
- **Foreign keys**: which dimension PKs are referenced (e.g. `student_fk → student_dim.student_pk`)
- **Measures**: numeric columns with business descriptions
- **Flags/indicators**: boolean derived columns with their logic
- **Audit columns**: `dbt_updated_at: current_timestamp()`

### Step 6: Define Seed Files

For any configurable business logic (thresholds, mappings, categorisations), specify seed files:

```
### seeds/<seed_name>.csv
**Purpose**: [What business rule this encodes]
**Columns**: [column names and types]
**Sample rows**: [3-5 representative rows]
**Used by**: [which models reference this seed]
```

Common seed patterns:
- Mark type mappings (e.g. attendance mark codes → present/absent/late)
- Risk score thresholds
- Category hierarchies
- Grade orderings

### Step 7: Generate Physical ERD

Produce a Mermaid `erDiagram` showing every warehouse model (and key staging models) with their columns, data types, primary keys, and foreign key relationships. Write this as a `## Physical Data Model` section within the data model specification document.

Use this template:

```
## Physical Data Model

```mermaid
erDiagram
    ENTITY_FCT {
        string entity_pk PK
        string dimension_fk FK
        date event_date
        int measure_column
        bool flag_column
        timestamp dbt_updated_at
    }
    DIMENSION_DIM {
        string dimension_pk PK
        string natural_key
        string display_name
        string category
        timestamp dbt_updated_at
    }
    AGGREGATE_SUMMARY {
        string summary_pk PK
        string dimension_fk FK
        int count_metric
        float rate_metric
        date summary_date
        timestamp dbt_updated_at
    }
    ENTITY_FCT }|--|| DIMENSION_DIM : "dimension_fk"
    AGGREGATE_SUMMARY }|--|| DIMENSION_DIM : "dimension_fk"
```
```

**ERD conventions**:
- Include all warehouse models (facts, dims, aggregates)
- Include staging models only if they are directly referenced by semantic layer (unusual)
- Mark surrogate keys as `PK`, foreign keys as `FK`
- Use types: `string`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `date`, `timestamp`
- All relationship lines must correspond to a FK → PK join defined in the model specs above
- Relationship label = the FK column name

### Step 8: Write Data Model Specification Document

Write to `.wire/<project_id>/design/data_model_specification.md`:

```markdown
# Data Model Specification: [Project Name]

**Client**: [Client Name]
**Project ID**: [Project ID]
**Generated**: [Date]
**Version**: 1.0

## 1. Source Definitions
[_sources.yml content for each source system]

## 2. Staging Models
[Per-model spec as defined in Step 3]

## 3. Integration Models
[Per-model spec as defined in Step 4, or "Not applicable"]

## 4. Warehouse Models
[Per-model spec as defined in Step 5]

## 5. Seed Files
[Per-seed spec as defined in Step 6, or "Not applicable"]

## 6. Cross-System Join Keys
[Table mapping natural keys across source systems, e.g.:]
| Left model | Column | Right model | Column | Notes |
|-----------|--------|------------|--------|-------|
| stg_focus__notes | enrolment_id | stg_prosolution__attendance | EnrolmentID | Case-sensitive match |

## 7. Physical Data Model

[Mermaid ERD as generated in Step 7]

## 8. dbt Test Coverage Plan
[Summary table: model → PK test → FK tests → custom tests]
```

### Step 9: Update Status

```yaml
data_model:
  generate: complete
  validate: not_started
  review: not_started
  file: design/data_model_specification.md
  generated_date: [today]
```

### Step 10: Sync to Jira (Optional)

Follow the Jira sync workflow in `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`:
- Artifact: `data_model`
- Action: `generate`
- Status: the generate state just written to status.md

### Step 11: Sync to Document Store (Optional)

If a document store is configured for this project, follow the workflow in `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`:
- `artifact_id`: `data_model`
- `artifact_name`: `Data Model`
- `file_path`: `.wire/releases/[release_folder]/design/data_model.md`
- `project_id`: the release folder path (e.g. `releases/01-discovery`)

If docstore sync fails, log the error and continue — do not block the generate command.

### Step 12: Confirm and Suggest Next Steps

```
## Data Model Specification Generated

**File**: .wire/<project_id>/design/data_model_specification.md

**Staging models**: [count]
**Integration models**: [count]
**Warehouse models**: [count] ([fact count] facts, [dim count] dims, [agg count] aggregates)
**Seed files**: [count]
**Physical ERD**: included ([entity count] entities, [relationship count] relationships)
**Cross-system joins**: [count — flag if > 0, these are high-risk]

### Next Steps

1. Validate the data model:
   /wire:data_model-validate <project_id>

2. After validation, review with analytics engineering lead:
   /wire:data_model-review <project_id>

NOTE: This is the most consequential review gate. Approving a model with
incorrect grain, wrong join keys, or missing entities is expensive to fix
after dbt code has been generated. Take time with this review.
```

## Edge Cases

### Source Column Names Unknown

If source schema examples are not in `artifacts/`, specify staging model columns at entity-attribute level from the conceptual model, and add:
```
NOTE: Column names are provisional — based on conceptual model attributes.
Actual source column names must be confirmed before dbt:generate.
Add source schema examples to artifacts/ and regenerate.
```

### Extending an Existing dbt Project

If the client has an existing dbt project:
1. Read existing staging models from `artifacts/` to understand current naming conventions
2. Follow those conventions for new models
3. Explicitly note which existing models are being extended vs which are net-new
4. Do not rename or restructure existing models — only add

### Complex Many-to-Many Relationships

If the conceptual model contains a many-to-many relationship, resolve it in the data model:
- Create a bridge/junction table (e.g. `student_course_bridge`)
- Name it clearly and document the resolution in Section 6

## Additional Output for `dashboard_first` Projects

When `project_type` is `dashboard_first`, additionally generate:

1. **`design/source_tables_ddl.sql`** — SQL DDL (CREATE TABLE statements) defining the expected source data schema, derived from the requirements, visualization catalog, and domain knowledge. Use the target warehouse dialect (e.g., BigQuery).

2. **`design/target_warehouse_ddl.sql`** — SQL DDL defining the target dimensional model (facts and dimensions) that will provide the measures and dimensions identified in the visualization catalog.

These DDL files serve as inputs for seed data generation (`/wire:seed_data-generate`) and the dbt project structure.

## Output

This command creates:
- `.wire/<project_id>/design/data_model_specification.md` (includes physical ERD)
- `.wire/<project_id>/design/source_tables_ddl.sql` (dashboard_first projects only)
- `.wire/<project_id>/design/target_warehouse_ddl.sql` (dashboard_first projects only)
- Updates `.wire/<project_id>/status.md`

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
