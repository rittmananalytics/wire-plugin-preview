# Generate the reverse-ETL retirement runbook — superseded and retire-classified syncs, ordered, with the evidence each replacement has run cleanly and the rollback

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command
- `specs/<path>.md` references are shared workflow docs shipped with this plugin — read them from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/specs/<path>.md`. If the path matches a Wire command (e.g. `specs/requirements/generate.md`), it means that command (`/wire:requirements-generate`) and its spec is already embedded in the command file.

## Tracing (opt-in, off by default)

description: Internal utility — opt-in step-level execution tracing to .wire/releases/<release>/trace.jsonl when WIRE_TRACE=true
---

# Tracing — Detailed, Opt-In, Step-Level Execution Trace

## Purpose

`execution_log.md` records one terse row per whole command (timestamp, command, result, a detail string capped at 120 characters). That's enough for a normal audit trail, but it can't answer "what actually happened inside that command, step by step" — which specific files it read, what it inferred, what it proposed, what a consultant decided, why. Tracing exists for engagements that want that depth: a complete, structured, append-only record of every step of every command, scoped to the release and release type it ran under.

**Off by default.** Tracing never runs unless `WIRE_TRACE=true` is set in the shell environment. If it isn't, skip this entire section — do nothing, check nothing further, proceed straight to the Workflow Specification exactly as if this section didn't exist. This is the common case and must add zero overhead.

## Where it writes

`.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl` — one JSON object per line (JSON Lines), append-only, alongside that release's `status.md` and `execution_log.md`.

For commands not scoped to a specific release (cross-cutting utilities with `release_types: []` in their own front-matter, or any command whose argument isn't a release folder), write to `.wire/trace.jsonl` at the engagement level instead, with `release` and `release_type` fields set to `null`.

This file is **local only** — nothing in it is ever sent anywhere, unlike the anonymous Segment telemetry event described elsewhere. It stays on the consultant's machine, inside the engagement's own repo, exactly like `execution_log.md`.

## What to log, and when

If `WIRE_TRACE=true`:

1. **Resolve context once, before anything else**: the release folder (from this command's own argument, if it has one) and `release_type` (read `.wire/releases/<release_folder>/status.md`'s `project_type` or `release_type` field). If this command has no release-folder argument, both are `null`.
2. **Emit a `command_start` event** before beginning the Workflow Specification below.
3. **As you work through the Workflow Specification's own numbered steps, emit a `step` event after completing each one** — and where a step itself has meaningfully distinct numbered sub-parts (e.g. "check location A, then location B, then infer a match, then propose it"), treat each of those as its own step event too rather than collapsing them into one. The `detail` field has no length limit and is not a summary — write what actually happened: values found, files read, decisions made and why, what was proposed and what the consultant chose. If this step involved the data model registry or any other external/optional resource, log it explicitly: whether it was reached, what was searched, what matched (or didn't, and why not), and whether/how the result was used downstream.
4. **Emit a `command_end` event** when the workflow finishes, with the same `result` value this command would write to `execution_log.md` (`complete`, `pass`, `fail`, `approved`, etc.).

## How to emit an event

Use this pattern for every event (adjust the heredoc body and the Python literals per call — this is a template, not a fixed script):

```bash
[ "${WIRE_TRACE:-false}" = "true" ] && {
  mkdir -p ".wire/releases/<release_folder>" 2>/dev/null
  cat > "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt" << 'WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF'
<the full, untruncated detail text for this event — safe to include quotes,
newlines, code snippets, anything; this heredoc is not shell-interpreted>
WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF
  python3 -c "
import json, datetime
detail = open('/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt').read().rstrip('\n')
event = {
    'ts': datetime.datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'),
    'release': '<release_folder_or_null>',
    'release_type': '<release_type_or_null>',
    'command': 'reverse-etl-retire-generate',
    'event': '<command_start|step|command_end>',
    'step': '<step_number_or_null>',
    'step_name': '<step_heading_or_null>',
    'result': '<result_value_or_null>',
    'detail': detail,
}
with open('.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl', 'a') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(event) + chr(10))
"
  rm -f "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt"
}
```

- `<release_folder_or_null>` / `<release_type_or_null>`: from Step 1 above; write the literal JSON `null` (no quotes) if either doesn't apply, or a quoted string if it does.
- `event`: `command_start`, `step`, or `command_end`.
- `step` / `step_name`: `null` for `command_start`/`command_end`; the step's own number (e.g. `"1.5"`) and heading (e.g. `"Check for a Canonical Vertical Match"`) for a `step` event.
- `result`: `null` except on `command_end`.
- Adjust the file path in the final `open(...)` call to `.wire/trace.jsonl` for engagement-level (non-release-scoped) commands.

## Rules

1. **Never block or fail the workflow.** If a trace write fails for any reason (disk full, permissions), continue the workflow regardless — trace failures are never surfaced to the user and never stop anything.
2. **Append only** — never rewrite or delete existing lines in `trace.jsonl`.
3. **This is additive to `execution_log.md` and Telemetry, not a replacement for either.** All three continue exactly as documented elsewhere; tracing is a separate, optional, much finer-grained record for engagements that opt in.
4. **Don't summarize into brevity.** The entire point of this mechanism over `execution_log.md` is that it isn't limited to a 120-character line — write the real detail.

## Data Safety — Read Before Proceeding

```
⚠️  DATA SAFETY REMINDER

This command produces a RUNBOOK. It disables and deletes nothing.

  Retirement is executed by the client, through a merged PR, in the order
  this runbook sets out. RA does not disable, pause, or delete a sync.

  A sync listed here is one whose replacement has already been proven, or
  one the audit classified decommission. Nothing else is listed.
```

If any generated step would disable, delete, or mutate a sync outside a client-merged PR, stop and report the conflict.

# Reverse ETL Retire — Generate

## Purpose

After switchover both the old sync and its twin exist, and nothing removed the old one. On one engagement, 84 of 643 syncs were classified `decommission`, and on its sister release 98 of 726, before counting those superseded by their own twins — and nothing in the command set tracked which were owed retirement or on what evidence. The estate quietly doubles: two syncs per destination, one live and one dormant, with no record of which is which.

This command produces the retirement runbook and the state tracking. Execution stays a client action, in the same PR-gated posture as every other reverse-ETL change.

## Prerequisites

- `reverse_etl_audit review: approved` — the source of `decommission` classifications (`specs/utils/reverse_etl_approach.md`)
- `migration/reverse_etl_twin_manifest.csv` exists where any sync is being retired **because it was superseded** (a supersession claim needs the twin it names)
- `migration/migration_verdict_log.csv` exists — the evidence a replacement actually passed

## Flags

- `--wave <id>` — restrict to the syncs `migration/migration_batching.csv` assigns to this wave, resolved identically to `reverse-etl-migration-generate`'s Step 1w. Wave-id form and normalisation follow the shared contract in `specs/utils/wave_resolution.md` (normative). Wave-labelled runbook.
- `--min-clean-days N` — how long a replacement must have been running cleanly before its predecessor is listed. Default `7`. Record the value used in the runbook; a shorter window is a judgment the client should see stated, not one buried in a flag.

## Who is eligible (deterministic)

Tests mirror this table exactly (`wire/tests/platform_migration/validate_reverse_etl_retire.py`). A sync is listed for retirement when it matches **either** row, and is refused otherwise with the recorded reason.

| # | Ground | Condition | Refusal reason when unmet |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Classified decommission** | The audit's `migration_approach` is `decommission` (the closed vocabulary in `specs/utils/reverse_etl_approach.md`; there is no `retire` value) | — (no replacement is expected; nothing to prove) |
| 2 | **Superseded by its twin** | A twin exists in the manifest for this sync id, the twin's `delivery_stage` is `production_verified`, its latest `reverse_etl_sync` verdict is `pass`, and it has been running cleanly for at least `--min-clean-days` | `no_twin` · `twin_not_production_verified` · `no_passing_verdict` · `verdict_not_pass` · `clean_window_too_short` |

**A sync whose replacement has no passing verdict is never listed.** `pass_qualified` is not sufficient here, for the same reason it is not sufficient at `batch-raise`: a reverse-ETL sync's output leaves the warehouse, so the external-exactness rule applies. Retiring the old sync on a qualified verdict removes the rollback path while the qualification is still unexplained.

**Clean running is evidence, not an assumption.** "Running cleanly" means, per replacement: its scheduled runs over the window all completed, none errored, and the planned row counts are within the tolerance the plan recorded — read from the sync-run history, not inferred from the absence of a complaint. A replacement that has never run cannot be clean, however good its verdict: record `clean_window_too_short` with the run count actually seen.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Resolve the candidate set

Read the audit for `decommission`-classified syncs, and the twin manifest for `authored` twins. Join on the normalised sync id (`reverse-etl-twin-generate`'s Step 0 rule — the same key throughout). Read the verdict log for each twin's latest `object_type: reverse_etl_sync` verdict, and each twin's `delivery_stage` from the register's `reverse_etl_sync` rows, which `migration-register-generate` seeds from the audit (wire#191); for a register that predates the sync seeding, read it from the twin manifest and a live repo read, and say which in the runbook.

Apply the eligibility table. Print the resolved list and, separately, every refused candidate with its reason — the refusals are the more useful half of the output, because each one names the evidence still owed.

### Step 2: Order the retirements

Order is not arbitrary and not alphabetical:

1. **`decommission`-classified syncs first.** They have no replacement to keep watching, so nothing is learned by waiting, and removing them shrinks the set everything else is reasoned about.
2. **Then superseded syncs, longest-clean first.** The most-proven replacement is the safest predecessor to remove, and going in that order means the earliest steps build confidence for the later ones.
3. **Group by destination.** All syncs writing to one destination retire together, so no destination is left served by a mix of old and new for longer than one step. A destination whose syncs are not all eligible retires none of them yet — record it as **held** with the blocking sync named.

### Step 3: State the evidence per sync

For each listed sync, the runbook records, in this order: the replacement twin's id, its verdict and verdict date, its `delivery_stage` and the live-repo evidence for it, the clean-run window observed (runs, errors, row-count range), and the destination it serves. A retirement step with no evidence block is not a step; it is a request.

For a `decommission`-classified sync, the evidence block instead records the classification, its adjudication note from the audit, and the confirmation that no twin exists — so a reader can tell the two grounds apart at a glance.

### Step 4: The rollback

Per sync, the rollback if the replacement turns out to be wrong after its predecessor is retired: revert the retirement PR to restore the old sync's config, confirm its source connection still resolves (the source warehouse may have been decommissioned on a different schedule — if it has, say so, because then this rollback does not exist and the runbook must say that plainly), and re-pause the replacement.

**Where the source warehouse is already gone, there is no rollback and the runbook says so per sync**, rather than describing a revert that would restore a sync pointing at nothing. That is the point at which retirement becomes irreversible, and a client is entitled to see it marked.

### Step 5: Write the runbook

**Output location**: `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/migration/reverse_etl_retirement_runbook.md` (`_{wave_id}.md` under `--wave`)

Structure:
1. Scope and the `--min-clean-days` value used
2. Summary counts: listed (by ground), refused (by reason), held (by destination)
3. The ordered retirement steps, each with its evidence block and its rollback (or its explicit no-rollback statement)
4. **Refused candidates**, each with the reason and the command that produces the missing evidence (`/wire:reverse-etl-equivalency-validate` for a missing verdict, `/wire:equivalency-post-merge-verify` for a twin not yet production-verified)
5. Held destinations, with the blocking sync named
6. The PR sequence: one retirement PR per ordered group, client-merged, with the monitoring window between groups

### Step 6: Update status

```yaml
artifacts:
  reverse_etl_retire:
    generate: complete
    generated_date: "{{TODAY}}"
    file: migration/reverse_etl_retirement_runbook.md   # or _{wave_id}.md under --wave
    min_clean_days: 7
    listed_decommission_classified: N
    listed_superseded: N
    refused: N
    refused_reasons: {no_twin: N, twin_not_production_verified: N, no_passing_verdict: N, verdict_not_pass: N, clean_window_too_short: N}
    held_destinations: N
    no_rollback_available: N     # syncs whose source warehouse is already decommissioned
    wave: "B01"                  # set only when run with --wave
    waves_complete: ["B01"]      # set only when run with --wave; accumulates across runs
```

### Step 7: Output next step

```
Retirement runbook: <n> syncs listed, <m> refused pending evidence.
The client executes it as PR-gated steps; nothing here disables a sync.
```

## Output Files

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/migration/reverse_etl_retirement_runbook.md` (`_{wave_id}` suffix under `--wave`)
- Updated `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/status.md`

## Post-Execution Hooks

After updating `status.md`, run these in sequence:

1. **Execution log** — Append one row to `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/execution_log.md` following `specs/utils/execution_log.md`.

2. **Jira sync** — Follow `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `reverse_etl_retire` as artifact, `generate` as action.

3. **Document store** — Follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `reverse_etl_retire` as artifact_id, `Reverse ETL Retirement` as artifact_name, and the `file` value from `artifacts.reverse_etl_retire` in status.md as file_path.

4. **Auto-commit** — Follow `specs/utils/commit.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as release_folder, `reverse_etl_retire` as artifact, `generate` as action.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

---
description: Internal utility — appends a log entry to the project's execution log after any generate/validate/review workflow or skill activation
---

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail | By | Session |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|----|---------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> | <by> | <session> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition, or an advisory gate satisfied by a director's ruling
  - `mode` — the director handed control over or took it back ("you drive" / "I'll drive"), per `specs/utils/director_operating_model.md`
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason
  - For a ruling-satisfied advisory gate: the precondition and the ruling id
- **By**: the git user (`git config user.name`), or `unknown` if git has no
  user configured. Who the run is attributable to, regardless of what typed it.
- **Session**: what invoked the run. One of:
  - `typed` — a person typed the command
  - `orchestrator` — the orchestrating session dispatched it, followed by its
    session id in brackets where one is available: `orchestrator [a1b2c3]`
  - a lane label — the lane that ran it, e.g. `dbt-developer [staging 1/2]`
  - `autopilot` — `/wire:autopilot` ran it

  This is the same value the `invoked_by` telemetry property carries
  (`specs/utils/telemetry.md`), read from `WIRE_INVOKED_BY` and defaulting to
  `typed`. The log records it per row so the record on disk answers the same
  question telemetry answers in aggregate.

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> | <by> | <session> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Stale Status Check

Immediately after appending a **command** row (this does not apply to skill activation entries), perform a quick freshness check against the project's `status.md`. This is additive to the logging behavior above — it never blocks the calling command and never modifies `status.md`.

**Process**:
1. Derive `artifact_id` from the command just logged: strip the `/wire:` prefix and the trailing `-generate`, `-validate`, or `-review` suffix (e.g. `/wire:migration-inventory-generate` → `migration_inventory`). If the command doesn't map to a recognizable artifact (e.g. `/wire:new`, `/wire:status`, `/wire:archive`), skip this check entirely.
2. Read the artifact's own block in `status.md`: `artifacts.<artifact_id>`.
3. Check whether that artifact has already passed its review/approval gate — its `review` field (or equivalent approval field) shows `pass`, `approved`, or `complete`.
4. If the gate has passed, scan every field in the `artifacts.<artifact_id>` block for a value that is still the literal string `TBD`, or an empty list (`[]`) / `null` where the artifact's own template expects a populated value (i.e. the field is not legitimately optional).
5. For each stale field found, emit a one-line warning in the command's output:
   ```
   ⚠ status.md still shows `<field>: TBD` for `<artifact_id>` despite review: pass — status may be stale
   ```
   Emit one warning per stale field — do not suppress after the first.
6. After the last warning (only when at least one was emitted), add one closing line offering the repair path:
   ```
   Run /wire:status-sync <release-folder> to reconcile the record (see specs/utils/status_sync.md).
   ```
   The offer is informational only — never block the calling command and never run the sync automatically.
7. If no stale fields are found, the review/approval gate has not yet passed, or `artifact_id` could not be derived: no output, proceed silently.

This check is self-contained within this utility, so every caller gets it automatically without any caller-side changes.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries, and never
   re-order them. A row is appended at the bottom, always. Rewriting the file
   to insert a row in timestamp order is a modification, not an append.
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
6. **Timestamps must not go backwards.** Because rows are appended in the order
   things happened, each row's timestamp is greater than or equal to the row
   above it. A row whose timestamp precedes its predecessor's means either the
   clock moved or a row was inserted out of order; both are record defects.
   `/wire:status-sync` flags them, naming both rows. This does not block any
   command — the log is written either way, and the flag is a repair prompt.
7. **Single writer in orchestrated mode.** When
   `specs/utils/director_operating_model.md`'s operating model is in force,
   only the orchestrating session appends to this file. Lanes write their own
   state files and the orchestrator writes the log rows from them (rule 6 of
   the operating model). Outside orchestrated mode, every command writes its
   own row as it always has.

## Legacy five-column rows

Logs written before the `By` and `Session` columns existed have four data
columns. They stay valid and are never rewritten:

- A reader parses columns positionally and treats a missing `By` or `Session`
  as unknown. It does not treat a five-column row as malformed and does not
  backfill it.
- The two columns are added on the next write. A file whose header still has
  four columns gets the new header written once, at the point the first
  six-column row is appended; existing rows are left as they are, so a log can
  legitimately hold both shapes.
- Nothing derives meaning from the absence of the columns. An old row is not
  "typed"; it is unknown.
