# Workshops Generate Command

## Purpose

Generate structured workshop materials when requirements need clarification or there are multiple technical approaches to discuss with stakeholders.

## Usage

```bash
/wire:workshops-generate YYYYMMDD_project_name
```

## Prerequisites

- Requirements should be generated (ideally with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Requirements for Clarification Needs

**Process**:
1. Read `requirements/requirements_specification.md`
2. Identify sections with:
   - `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers
   - `[TBD]` markers
   - Multiple options or approaches mentioned
   - Ambiguous acceptance criteria

**Count issues**:
```
Found 7 items needing clarification:
- 3 in functional requirements
- 2 in data sources
- 2 in technical approach
```

### Step 2: Categorize Workshop Topics

**Group clarifications by category:**

| Category | Topics | Priority |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Requirements | Ambiguous functional requirements | High |
| Data | Data source ownership, access, refresh rates | High |
| Technical | Technology choices, architecture decisions | Medium |
| Timeline | Milestone dependencies, resource constraints | Medium |
| Scope | In/out of scope boundary questions | High |

### Step 3: Generate Workshop Agenda

**File**: `.wire/<project>/requirements/workshop_agenda.md`

```markdown

```

### Step 5: Generate Technical Options Analysis (if needed)

**File**: `.wire/<project>/requirements/workshop_technical_options.md`

```markdown
# Technical Options Analysis

## Data Pipeline Implementation Options

### Option A: Cloud Function + Cloud Scheduler

**Pros:**
- Serverless, auto-scaling
- Pay-per-invocation
- Simple to deploy

**Cons:**
- 9-minute execution timeout
- Cold start latency
- Complex for long-running extracts

**Cost:** ~$X/month
**Complexity:** Low
**Recommended for:** Quick, frequent extracts

### Option B: Cloud Run + Cloud Scheduler

**Pros:**
- No execution timeout
- Containerized (flexible runtime)
- Auto-scaling

**Cons:**
- Higher cost for continuous running
- More complex deployment

**Cost:** ~$Y/month
**Complexity:** Medium
**Recommended for:** Long-running extracts

### Option C: BigQuery Data Transfer

**Pros:**
- Fully managed
- Native BigQuery integration
- Simple configuration

**Cons:**
- Limited to supported sources
- Less flexible

**Cost:** ~$Z/month
**Complexity:** Low
**Recommended for:** Standard sources (Salesforce, GA4, etc.)

## Recommendation

[Based on requirements analysis, recommend an option with reasoning]
```

### Step 6: Update Status

**Process**:
1. Read `status.md`
2. Update artifacts.workshops section:
   ```yaml
   workshops:
     generate: complete
     review: not_started
     clarification_count: 7
     generated_date: 2026-02-13
   ```
3. Write updated status.md

### Step 7: Sync to Jira (Optional)

Follow the Jira sync workflow in `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`:
- Artifact: `workshops`
- Action: `generate`
- Status: the generate state just written to status.md

### Step 7.5: Sync to Linear (Optional)

Follow the Linear sync workflow in `specs/utils/linear_sync.md`:
- Artifact: `workshops`
- Action: `generate`
- Status: the generate state just written to status.md

### Step 7.6: Sync to Document Store (Optional)

If a document store is configured for this engagement, follow the workflow in `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`:
- Artifact: `workshops`
- Primary file: `.wire/[release_folder]/requirements/workshop_agenda.md`
- Also sync: `workshop_decision_matrix.md` and `workshop_technical_options.md` (if generated)

Fail gracefully if the document store is unavailable — this step is optional and additive.

### Step 8: Confirm and Suggest Next Steps

**Output**:

```
## Workshop Materials Generated Successfully

**Workshop Agenda:** .wire/[folder]/requirements/workshop_agenda.md
**Decision Matrix:** .wire/[folder]/requirements/workshop_decision_matrix.md
**Technical Options:** .wire/[folder]/requirements/workshop_technical_options.md

### Clarifications Identified

7 items need clarification across:
- Requirements: 3 items
- Data sources: 2 items
- Technical approach: 2 items

### Next Steps

1. **Schedule the workshop** with stakeholders
   - Suggested duration: 2 hours
   - Recommend including: [key stakeholders]

2. **Review workshop materials** before the session
   - Share agenda with attendees in advance
   - Ensure technical SMEs are available

3. **After the workshop**:
   - Fill in decision matrix
   - Update requirements document with decisions
   - Re-validate: `/wire:requirements-validate [folder]`
   - Get approval: `/wire:requirements-review [folder]`
```

## Edge Cases

### No Clarifications Found

If requirements are clear:
```
No major clarifications needed in requirements.

Requirements appear complete. Consider:
1. Review requirements directly: `/wire:requirements-review [folder]`
2. Generate workshop anyway for stakeholder alignment

Proceed with workshop generation? (y/n)
```

### Requirements Not Generated

If requirements don't exist:
```
Error: Requirements not found.

Generate requirements first: /wire:requirements-generate [folder]
```

## Output

This command creates:
- `.wire/<project>/requirements/workshop_agenda.md`
- `.wire/<project>/requirements/workshop_decision_matrix.md`
- `.wire/<project>/requirements/workshop_technical_options.md` (if technical decisions needed)
- Updates `.wire/<project>/status.md`

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
