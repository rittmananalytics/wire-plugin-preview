## Data Safety — Read Before Proceeding

Before generating any copy steps, read `data_safety` and `migration.tenant_predicate` from status.md and output this reminder:

```
⚠️  DATA SAFETY REMINDER

Source platform (snowflake): READ ONLY.
  The bulk copy issues SELECT / COPY INTO (export) against the source only.
  Do NOT run INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or any DDL against the source.

Tenant carve-out scope — this copy moves ONE tenant's data only:
  Every extract is filtered by migration.tenant_predicate ([tenant_predicate]).
  A copy step that omits the predicate, or whose predicate does not match
  migration.tenant_predicate, MUST NOT run.

Target writes go to: [data_safety.target_project or migration.target_project]

[If data_safety.production_projects is non-empty:]
BLOCKED production projects (never a copy destination):
  [list each production project ID]
```

If any generated copy step would write to a source platform, omit the tenant predicate, target a production project listed in `data_safety.production_projects`, or write anywhere other than the designated target, stop immediately and report the conflict before proceeding.

# Bulk Copy Migration — Generate

## Purpose

Generates the runbook for a one-off **bulk historical copy of a single tenant's data from Snowflake to BigQuery**, using the **BigQuery Data Transfer Service** (managed Snowflake connector) or a **GCS-staged** path (Snowflake `COPY INTO` an external GCS stage → BigQuery load from GCS). This is the carve-out alternative to re-ingestion: it moves the existing historical rows in bulk rather than re-running Fivetran/connector ingestion against the target.

This command runs only in **tenant carve-out** scope (`migration.scope == tenant_carveout`). For a full migration, ingestion is handled by `/wire:ingestion-migration-generate` instead.

**Always a runbook/script.** Native SQL and the BigQuery Storage Write / load path are always available — there is no MCP-server dependency and no execution-vs-runbook branching. `method` is always `runbook`.

**Two-stage copy with a validation gate.** A pilot partition is copied first and verified with equivalency checks before the remainder is copied. The first copy execution is a safety gate requiring written approval — see `review.md`.

## Prerequisites

- `target_setup review: approved`
- `migration.scope == tenant_carveout` and `migration.tenant_predicate` is set
- Target warehouse schemas exist (target_setup scripts executed)

## Inputs

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/ingestion_audit.md` — the in-scope source datasets/tables (connectors with `include_in_migration: true` identify the landed tables to copy)
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/migration/migration_strategy.md` — copy mechanism decision (BQ Data Transfer Service vs GCS-staged), per-table tolerances, and the tenant-scoped IAM model
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/status.md` — `migration.scope`, `migration.tenant_predicate`, `data_safety`, target platform/project

## Workflow

### Step 1: Confirm prerequisites

1. Confirm `target_setup review: approved` in status.md. If not, stop with message.
2. Confirm `migration.scope == tenant_carveout`. If it is `full_migration` or absent, stop: "Bulk copy migration runs in tenant carve-out scope only. For a full migration use /wire:ingestion-migration-generate."
3. Confirm `migration.tenant_predicate` is set. If null, stop: "migration.tenant_predicate is required to scope the carve-out copy."

### Step 2: Pre-flight — scoped service account and tenant guard

There is no MCP probe. Instead, verify the safety posture for a pilot export before generating any copy step:

1. **Scoped service account** — confirm the migration strategy designates a service account scoped to *only* the extracted tenant's target project/dataset (and, for the GCS-staged path, only the dedicated staging bucket). Record its identity in the runbook. The copy must not run under a broad/admin credential.
2. **Tenant guard** — confirm a guard is in place so a misconfigured copy cannot touch another tenant's data:
   - every source extract carries `WHERE {migration.tenant_predicate}`;
   - the destination resolves to `migration.target_project` and is not in `data_safety.production_projects`;
   - for GCS-staged, the staging bucket is dedicated to this carve-out and the service account has no access to other tenants' buckets.
3. Output the pre-flight table before generating the runbook:

```
Bulk Copy Pre-flight Check
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Copy mechanism      : BigQuery Data Transfer Service | GCS-staged
  Tenant predicate    : [migration.tenant_predicate]
  Scoped SA           : [service account identity]
  Target destination  : [migration.target_project] / [dataset]
  Tenant guard        : ✅ predicate on every extract · destination verified
  Tables in scope     : N

```

If the scoped service account or the tenant guard cannot be confirmed, stop and report — do not generate copy steps that could run without them.

### Step 3: Generate the bulk copy runbook

**Output location**: `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/migration/bulk_copy_migration_runbook.md`

For each in-scope source dataset/table (smallest / lowest-risk first), document the copy via the mechanism chosen in the migration strategy:

- **BigQuery Data Transfer Service** — a transfer config per table whose query applies `WHERE {migration.tenant_predicate}` (or reads a tenant-scoped source view), landing in the target dataset.
- **GCS-staged** — Snowflake `COPY INTO @<tenant_stage> FROM (SELECT ... WHERE {migration.tenant_predicate})` to the dedicated GCS bucket, then a BigQuery load job from that bucket into the target table.

Structure the runbook with these sections (mirroring the ingestion migration runbook):

1. **Pre-flight checklist** — scoped service account in place, tenant guard confirmed, target schemas exist, staging bucket dedicated (GCS-staged path), copy mechanism selected.
2. **Two-stage copy steps** (smallest / lowest-risk table first):
   - **Stage 1 — pilot partition.** For each table, copy a single bounded partition (e.g. one month, or a bounded slice of the partition key), filtered by the tenant predicate.
   - **Validation gate.** Run equivalency **check 1 (row count)** and **check 6 (row-level checksum)** scoped to that partition and the tenant predicate, on both source and target (see `equivalency/validate.md`). Proceed to Stage 2 only if both pass. On failure, stop and route to `/wire:equivalency-investigate`.
   - **Stage 2 — remainder.** Copy the rest of the table's rows for the tenant, then re-run check 1 over the full tenant row set.
3. **Credential rotation checklist** — scoped service account key, GCS bucket access, BigQuery Data Editor on the target dataset only; nothing granted on other tenants' projects.
4. **Post-copy validation steps** — hand off to `/wire:equivalency-validate` for the full seven-check pass (tenant-scoped) once all tables are copied.
5. **Source decommission procedure** — deferred to the cutover phase; the source stays live and unmodified throughout the copy.

### Step 4: Update status

```yaml
artifacts:
  bulk_copy_migration:
    generate: complete
    method: runbook
    file: migration/bulk_copy_migration_runbook.md
    generated_date: "{{TODAY}}"
    copy_mechanism: bq_data_transfer | gcs_staged
    tables_in_runbook: N
    tenant_predicate: "{{migration.tenant_predicate}}"
```

### Step 5: Output next command

```
/wire:bulk-copy-migration-validate $ARGUMENTS
```

## Output Files

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/migration/bulk_copy_migration_runbook.md`
- Updated `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/status.md`


## Post-Execution Hooks

After updating `status.md`, run these in sequence:

1. **Execution log** — Append one row to `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/execution_log.md` following `specs/utils/execution_log.md`.

2. **Jira sync** — Follow `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `bulk_copy_migration` as artifact, `generate` as action.

3. **Document store** — Follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `bulk_copy_migration` as artifact_id, `Bulk Copy Migration` as artifact_name, and the `file` value from `artifacts.bulk_copy_migration` in status.md as file_path.

4. **Auto-commit** — Follow `specs/utils/commit.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as release_folder, `bulk_copy_migration` as artifact, `generate` as action.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
