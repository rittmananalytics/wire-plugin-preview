# Run dbt tests and validation

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command
- `specs/<path>.md` references are shared workflow docs shipped with this plugin — read them from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/specs/<path>.md`. If the path matches a Wire command (e.g. `specs/requirements/generate.md`), it means that command (`/wire:requirements-generate`) and its spec is already embedded in the command file.

## Tracing (opt-in, off by default)

description: Internal utility — opt-in step-level execution tracing to .wire/releases/<release>/trace.jsonl when WIRE_TRACE=true
---

# Tracing — Detailed, Opt-In, Step-Level Execution Trace

## Purpose

`execution_log.md` records one terse row per whole command (timestamp, command, result, a detail string capped at 120 characters). That's enough for a normal audit trail, but it can't answer "what actually happened inside that command, step by step" — which specific files it read, what it inferred, what it proposed, what a consultant decided, why. Tracing exists for engagements that want that depth: a complete, structured, append-only record of every step of every command, scoped to the release and release type it ran under.

**Off by default.** Tracing never runs unless `WIRE_TRACE=true` is set in the shell environment. If it isn't, skip this entire section — do nothing, check nothing further, proceed straight to the Workflow Specification exactly as if this section didn't exist. This is the common case and must add zero overhead.

## Where it writes

`.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl` — one JSON object per line (JSON Lines), append-only, alongside that release's `status.md` and `execution_log.md`.

For commands not scoped to a specific release (cross-cutting utilities with `release_types: []` in their own front-matter, or any command whose argument isn't a release folder), write to `.wire/trace.jsonl` at the engagement level instead, with `release` and `release_type` fields set to `null`.

This file is **local only** — nothing in it is ever sent anywhere, unlike the anonymous Segment telemetry event described elsewhere. It stays on the consultant's machine, inside the engagement's own repo, exactly like `execution_log.md`.

## What to log, and when

If `WIRE_TRACE=true`:

1. **Resolve context once, before anything else**: the release folder (from this command's own argument, if it has one) and `release_type` (read `.wire/releases/<release_folder>/status.md`'s `project_type` or `release_type` field). If this command has no release-folder argument, both are `null`.
2. **Emit a `command_start` event** before beginning the Workflow Specification below.
3. **As you work through the Workflow Specification's own numbered steps, emit a `step` event after completing each one** — and where a step itself has meaningfully distinct numbered sub-parts (e.g. "check location A, then location B, then infer a match, then propose it"), treat each of those as its own step event too rather than collapsing them into one. The `detail` field has no length limit and is not a summary — write what actually happened: values found, files read, decisions made and why, what was proposed and what the consultant chose. If this step involved the data model registry or any other external/optional resource, log it explicitly: whether it was reached, what was searched, what matched (or didn't, and why not), and whether/how the result was used downstream.
4. **Emit a `command_end` event** when the workflow finishes, with the same `result` value this command would write to `execution_log.md` (`complete`, `pass`, `fail`, `approved`, etc.).

## How to emit an event

Use this pattern for every event (adjust the heredoc body and the Python literals per call — this is a template, not a fixed script):

```bash
[ "${WIRE_TRACE:-false}" = "true" ] && {
  mkdir -p ".wire/releases/<release_folder>" 2>/dev/null
  cat > "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt" << 'WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF'
<the full, untruncated detail text for this event — safe to include quotes,
newlines, code snippets, anything; this heredoc is not shell-interpreted>
WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF
  python3 -c "
import json, datetime
detail = open('/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt').read().rstrip('\n')
event = {
    'ts': datetime.datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'),
    'release': '<release_folder_or_null>',
    'release_type': '<release_type_or_null>',
    'command': 'dbt-validate',
    'event': '<command_start|step|command_end>',
    'step': '<step_number_or_null>',
    'step_name': '<step_heading_or_null>',
    'result': '<result_value_or_null>',
    'detail': detail,
}
with open('.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl', 'a') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(event) + chr(10))
"
  rm -f "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt"
}
```

- `<release_folder_or_null>` / `<release_type_or_null>`: from Step 1 above; write the literal JSON `null` (no quotes) if either doesn't apply, or a quoted string if it does.
- `event`: `command_start`, `step`, or `command_end`.
- `step` / `step_name`: `null` for `command_start`/`command_end`; the step's own number (e.g. `"1.5"`) and heading (e.g. `"Check for a Canonical Vertical Match"`) for a `step` event.
- `result`: `null` except on `command_end`.
- Adjust the file path in the final `open(...)` call to `.wire/trace.jsonl` for engagement-level (non-release-scoped) commands.

## Rules

1. **Never block or fail the workflow.** If a trace write fails for any reason (disk full, permissions), continue the workflow regardless — trace failures are never surfaced to the user and never stop anything.
2. **Append only** — never rewrite or delete existing lines in `trace.jsonl`.
3. **This is additive to `execution_log.md` and Telemetry, not a replacement for either.** All three continue exactly as documented elsewhere; tracing is a separate, optional, much finer-grained record for engagements that opt in.
4. **Don't summarize into brevity.** The entire point of this mechanism over `execution_log.md` is that it isn't limited to a 120-character line — write the real detail.

# dbt Validation Command

## Purpose

Validate generated dbt models by running dbt tests, checking naming conventions, verifying SQL structure, model configuration, testing coverage, documentation coverage, and optionally running sqlfluff. Produces a structured validation report with severity-rated issues.

> **Per-layer alternative**: If the dbt project was built layer-by-layer instead of via `/wire:dbt-generate`, validate each layer with its own command instead: `/wire:dbt-staging-validate`, `/wire:dbt-integration-validate`, `/wire:dbt-warehouse-validate` — run after the corresponding `/wire:dbt-*-generate` command.

## Usage

```bash
/wire:dbt-validate YYYYMMDD_project_name
```

## Prerequisites

- dbt models must be generated (`/wire:dbt-generate` complete)
- dbt models must be run successfully (`/wire:utils-run-dbt` complete)
- dbt Cloud or dbt Core configured

## Workflow

### Step 1: Verify dbt Models Exist

**Process**:
1. Check that `dbt.generate == complete` in status.md
2. Verify dbt models exist in `dbt/models/`

**If not generated**:
```
Error: dbt models not generated yet.

Run `/wire:dbt-generate [folder]` first.
```

### Step 1.5: Load Convention Source

**Priority Order (2-tier system):**

1. **Project-specific conventions** (highest priority)
   - Check for `.dbt-conventions.md` in project root
   - Check for `dbt_coding_conventions.md` in project root
   - Check for `docs/dbt_conventions.md` in project

2. **Embedded conventions** (fallback — use the conventions defined in this spec)

**Detection:**
- Use Glob to search for convention files in project root
- If found, read and use project conventions
- If not found, use the embedded conventions below
- Note which source is being used in validation output

### Step 2: Run dbt Tests

**Process**:
1. Ask user how to run tests:
   - dbt Cloud (API call)
   - dbt Core (local command)
   - Show manual command

**For dbt Core**:
```bash
cd dbt/
dbt test
```

**Capture test results**:
- Total tests run
- Tests passed
- Tests failed (with details)

### Step 3: Check Naming Conventions

#### 3.1 File and Model Naming

| Check | Rule | Example | Severity |
|-------|------|---------|----------|
| Singular names | All objects are SINGULAR | `user` not `users` | Critical |
| Staging models | `stg_<group>__<entity>.sql` | `stg_salesforce__user.sql` | Critical |
| Integration models | `int_<group>__<entity>.sql` | `int_core__user.sql` | Critical |
| Intermediate models | `int_<group>__<entity>__<action>.sql` (past tense verbs) | `int_core__user__unioned.sql` | Critical |
| Warehouse dimensions | `wh_<group>__<entity>_dim.sql` | `wh_core__user_dim.sql` | Critical |
| Warehouse facts | `wh_<group>__<entity>_fact.sql` | `wh_finance__transaction_fact.sql` | Critical |
| Warehouse cross-attribute | `wh_<group>__<entity>_xa.sql` (bridge / many-to-many / cross-entity attribute models) | `wh_core__user_role_xa.sql` | Critical |
| Aggregate tables | `wh_<group>__<entity>_agg.sql` | `wh_core__course_summary_by_year_agg.sql` | Critical |
| Files | Lowercase with underscores only | ✅ `wh_core__user_dim.sql` ❌ `StudentDim.sql` | Critical |

**Directory Structure Check**:
```
models/
├── staging/
│   └── <group>/
│       ├── stg_<group>.yml
│       └── stg_<group>__<entity>.sql
├── integration/
│   ├── int_<group>/
│   │   ├── intermediate/
│   │   │   ├── intermediate.yml
│   │   │   └── int_<group>__<entity>__<action>.sql
│   │   ├── int_<group>__<entity>.sql
│   │   └── integration.yml
└── warehouse/
    └── wh_<group>/
        ├── wh_<group>.yml
        ├── wh_<group>__<entity>_dim.sql
        ├── wh_<group>__<entity>_fact.sql
        └── wh_<group>__<entity>_xa.sql
```

**Violations to Flag:**
- Plural object names
- Missing or incorrect prefixes/suffixes
- Non-standard directory structure
- Mismatched filename and directory location

#### 3.2 Field Naming Conventions

For each model, check ALL fields against these conventions:

| Type | Pattern | Example | Severity |
|------|---------|---------|----------|
| Primary Key | `<entity>_pk`, generated via `dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(...)` | `user_pk`, `transaction_pk` | Critical |
| Foreign Key | `<referenced_entity>_fk`, generated via `dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(...)` | `user_fk`, `account_fk` | Critical |
| Natural Key | `<descriptive_name>_natural_key` | `salesforce_user_natural_key` | Important |
| Date | `<event>_dt` | `user_created_dt` | Important |
| Timestamp (UTC) | `<event>_ts` — always assumed UTC unless otherwise indicated | `created_ts`, `updated_ts` | Important |
| Timestamp (non-UTC) | `<event>_<tz>_ts` — timezone tag inserted before `_ts` | `created_cet_ts`, `created_pt_ts` | Important |
| Boolean | `is_<state>`, `has_<thing>`, or `was_<event>` | `is_active`, `has_subscription`, `was_refunded` | Important |
| Revenue / Money | `<entity>_<measure>_amount` — decimal currency, converted from cents at the staging layer | `user_account_balance_amount` (not `price_in_cents`) | Important |
| Common fields | `<entity>_<field>` prefix | `customer_name` (not just `name`) | Important |

**Type Casting:**
- Always use dbt's type-cast macros, never raw SQL types: `{{ dbt.type_string() }}`, `{{ dbt.type_numeric() }}`, `{{ dbt.type_boolean() }}`, `{{ dbt.type_timestamp() }}`, `{{ type_date() }}` (community macro, no `dbt.` prefix)
- This keeps models portable across warehouses (BigQuery / Snowflake / Databricks / Postgres)

**General Rules:**
- All names in `snake_case`
- Use business terminology, not source terminology
- Avoid SQL reserved words
- Consistency across models (same field names for same concepts)

**Violations to Flag:**
- Inconsistent naming patterns across models
- Missing `_pk`/`_fk` suffixes; PKs/FKs not generated via `dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key`
- Timestamps without `_ts` suffix; dates without `_dt` suffix; non-UTC timestamps without a timezone tag before `_ts`
- Booleans without `is_`/`has_`/`was_` prefix
- Revenue columns without `_amount` suffix
- Raw SQL type casts instead of `dbt.type_*()` macros
- Reserved words as column names

#### 3.3 Field Ordering

Check that fields in each model's `select` list follow this ordering:

1. **Keys** — pk, fks, natural keys
2. **Attributes** — dimensions, slicing fields, descriptive columns
3. **Indexes / ranks** — `row_number()`, rank columns, sequence positions
4. **Metrics** — measures, aggregatable values, `_amount` columns
5. **Booleans** — `is_*`, `has_*`, `was_*` flags
6. **Temporal data types** — `_dt`, `_ts` columns last

### Step 3.5: Validate SQL Structure

For each model file, check:

#### CTE Structure

| Check | Rule | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| Refs at top | All `{{ ref() }}` and `{{ source() }}` calls in top CTEs | Critical |
| CTE naming | `s_` prefix for ref/source CTEs | Important |
| Final CTE | Must have `final` CTE with `select * from final` at end | Critical |
| One logical unit | Each CTE does one transformation | Info |

**Required Pattern:**
```sql
with

s_source_table as (
    select * from {{ ref('source_model') }}
),

transformation_cte as (
    select ... from s_source_table
),

final as (
    select ... from transformation_cte
)

select * from final
```

**Violations to Flag:**
- `ref()` or `source()` calls outside of top CTEs
- Missing final CTE
- Non-staging models selecting from `{{ source() }}`

#### SQL Style

| Check | Rule | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| Indentation | 4 spaces (not tabs) | Important |
| Line length | Max 80 characters | Info |
| Case | Lowercase field names and SQL functions | Important |
| Aliases | Always use `as` keyword | Important |
| Joins | Explicit: `inner join`, `left join` (never just `join`) | Critical |
| Table aliases | Full descriptive names, not initialisms (`customer`, not `c`) | Important |
| Column prefixes | Required when joining 2+ tables | Important |
| Union | `union all` preferred over `union distinct` | Info |
| Group by | Column names, not numbers | Important |

**Violations to Flag:**
- Implicit joins or missing join qualifiers
- Hard-to-understand table aliases (single letters)
- Uppercase SQL keywords or functions
- Improper indentation or line length

### Step 3.6: Validate Model Configuration

| Check | Rule | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| Warehouse models | Always materialized as `table` | Critical |
| Staging models | `view` or ephemeral (not `table` unless performance requires) | Important |
| Integration models | `view` or ephemeral (not `table` unless performance requires) | Important |
| Config placement | Model-specific in `{{ config() }}` block, directory-wide in `dbt_project.yml` | Info |

**Violations to Flag:**
- Warehouse models not materialized as tables
- Unnecessary table materializations in staging/integration
- Config that should be in `dbt_project.yml` but is in model

### Step 3.7: Validate Testing Coverage

#### Minimum Testing Requirements

**Every Model Must Have:**
- Entry in a `schema.yml` file
- Primary key with `unique` and `not_null` tests

**By Layer:**

| Layer | Required Tests | Severity |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Staging | `unique` + `not_null` on pk, `not_null` on critical fields | Critical |
| Integration | `unique` + `not_null` on pk, `dbt_utils.unique_combination_of_columns` for multi-source | Critical |
| Warehouse | `unique` + `not_null` on pk, `relationships` on all fk fields | Critical |

**Additional Tests to Check:**
- `relationships` tests for foreign keys
- `accepted_values` for enum/status fields
- `not_null_where` for conditional requirements
- Custom data tests in `tests/` directory for KPI validation

**Schema.yml Location:**
- Every subdirectory should contain a `.yml` file
- Named after directory: `stg_<source>.yml`, `integration.yml`, etc.

**Violations to Flag:**
- Missing `schema.yml` file for a subdirectory
- Models without any test coverage
- Primary keys without `unique`/`not_null` tests
- Missing `relationships` tests on foreign keys
- Integration models without `unique_combination_of_columns`

### Step 3.8: Validate Documentation Coverage

| Layer | Required Coverage | Severity |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| Staging | 100% — all models and columns documented | Critical |
| Warehouse | 100% — all models and columns documented | Critical |
| Integration | As needed — document complex logic and special cases | Important |

**Checks:**
- Every staging model has a `description` in schema.yml
- Every warehouse model has a `description` in schema.yml
- Every column in staging/warehouse has a `description`
- Descriptions use business terminology (not just field names)
- Complex/calculated fields have explanatory descriptions

**Best Practices to Check:**
- Use of `{% docs %}` blocks for shared documentation
- Doc blocks stored in `models/docs/` directory
- Descriptions focus on WHY, not just WHAT

**Violations to Flag:**
- Staging/warehouse models without descriptions
- Missing column documentation in staging/warehouse
- Vague or unhelpful descriptions (e.g., description matches field name)

### Step 3.9: Run sqlfluff Validation (If Available)

**Process:**
1. Check for sqlfluff: `which sqlfluff`
2. Check for `.sqlfluff` config in project root

**If sqlfluff available:**
```bash
sqlfluff lint models/ --dialect <bigquery|snowflake|postgres>
```

Include sqlfluff violations in validation output. sqlfluff enforces many style conventions automatically:
- Line length limits
- Indentation consistency
- Capitalization rules
- Trailing commas
- Whitespace rules

**If not available:**
- Note in output: "sqlfluff not detected — recommend installing for automated linting"
- Provide manual validation of style conventions (Steps 3.5 and above)

### Step 4: Verify Model Dependencies

**Check for**:
- All `{{ ref() }}` references point to existing models
- No circular dependencies
- Proper layer order (staging → integration → warehouse)

**Use**:
```bash
dbt compile --select [models]
```

If compile fails, there are dependency issues.

### Step 5: Generate Validation Report

**Output Format:**

```markdown
## dbt Model Validation Report

**Project:** [PROJECT_NAME]
**Status:** PASS | FAIL
**Convention Source:** [project-specific / embedded defaults]
**Models Location:** dbt/models/

## Recommendations

### Critical Issues (must fix)
1. [issue description]
   - **Location:** [file:line or section]
   - **Current:** `[current code]`
   - **Should be:** `[correct pattern]`
   - **Reason:** [why this matters]

### Important Issues (should fix)
[same format]

### Nice-to-have Improvements
[same format]

---

### Next Steps

1. **Fix issues** (if FAIL): Address critical and important issues, then re-validate
2. **Review dbt models with team**: `/wire:dbt-review [folder]`
3. **Generate semantic layer**: `/wire:semantic_layer-generate [folder]`
```

## Priority Levels

| Level | Criteria | Examples |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Critical** | Breaks functionality, violates core principles, missing required tests | Missing pk tests, `ref()` outside CTEs, warehouse not materialized as table |
| **Important** | Inconsistent with conventions, maintainability issues, missing documentation | Wrong field naming, missing docs, implicit joins, no table aliases |
| **Nice-to-have** | Style preferences, minor optimizations, enhanced documentation | Line length, indentation, `union all` vs `union distinct` |

### Step 6: Update Status

**Process**:
1. Read `status.md`
2. Update artifacts.dbt section:
   ```yaml
   dbt:
     generate: complete
     validate: pass | fail
     review: not_started
     tests_passed: 32
     tests_failed: 0
     validated_date: 2026-02-13
   ```
3. Write updated status.md

### Step 7: Sync to Jira (Optional)

Follow the Jira sync workflow in `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`:
- Artifact: `dbt`
- Action: `validate`
- Status: the validate state just written to status.md (pass/fail)

## Edge Cases

### dbt Not Run Yet

If models haven't been run:
```
Warning: dbt models haven't been run yet.

Tests require models to be materialized first.

Run dbt models: /wire:utils-run-dbt [folder]
```

### dbt Command Not Found

If dbt not installed (local mode):
```
Error: dbt command not found.

Please either:
1. Install dbt: pip install dbt-bigquery
2. Use dbt Cloud instead
3. Show manual test commands
```

### Some Tests Failing

If tests fail:
- Set validate status to `fail`
- Show which tests failed with severity classification
- Suggest fixes based on test type
- User must fix data/models and re-run

### No Convention Source Found

```
Note: No project-specific conventions found.
Using embedded conventions from this specification.

To use project-specific conventions, create one of:
- .dbt-conventions.md
- dbt_coding_conventions.md
- docs/dbt_conventions.md
```

## Common Violations Reference

❌ **Don't:**
- Use plural object names (`users` → use `user`)
- Put `ref()` calls outside top CTEs
- Use implicit joins or just `join` (use `inner join`, `left join`)
- Use table alias initialisms (`c` → use `customer`)
- Mix tabs and spaces (use 4 spaces)
- Skip tests on primary keys
- Leave staging/warehouse models undocumented
- Select from sources in non-staging models
- Use `union distinct` without good reason
- Look up PKs in separate queries (generate with `dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key()`)

✅ **Do:**
- Use singular names

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

---
description: Internal utility — appends a log entry to the project's execution log after any generate/validate/review workflow or skill activation
---

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail | By | Session |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|----|---------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> | <by> | <session> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition, or an advisory gate satisfied by a director's ruling
  - `mode` — the director handed control over or took it back ("you drive" / "I'll drive"), per `specs/utils/director_operating_model.md`
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason
  - For a ruling-satisfied advisory gate: the precondition and the ruling id
- **By**: the git user (`git config user.name`), or `unknown` if git has no
  user configured. Who the run is attributable to, regardless of what typed it.
- **Session**: what invoked the run. One of:
  - `typed` — a person typed the command
  - `orchestrator` — the orchestrating session dispatched it, followed by its
    session id in brackets where one is available: `orchestrator [a1b2c3]`
  - a lane label — the lane that ran it, e.g. `dbt-developer [staging 1/2]`
  - `autopilot` — `/wire:autopilot` ran it

  This is the same value the `invoked_by` telemetry property carries
  (`specs/utils/telemetry.md`), read from `WIRE_INVOKED_BY` and defaulting to
  `typed`. The log records it per row so the record on disk answers the same
  question telemetry answers in aggregate.

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> | <by> | <session> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Stale Status Check

Immediately after appending a **command** row (this does not apply to skill activation entries), perform a quick freshness check against the project's `status.md`. This is additive to the logging behavior above — it never blocks the calling command and never modifies `status.md`.

**Process**:
1. Derive `artifact_id` from the command just logged: strip the `/wire:` prefix and the trailing `-generate`, `-validate`, or `-review` suffix (e.g. `/wire:migration-inventory-generate` → `migration_inventory`). If the command doesn't map to a recognizable artifact (e.g. `/wire:new`, `/wire:status`, `/wire:archive`), skip this check entirely.
2. Read the artifact's own block in `status.md`: `artifacts.<artifact_id>`.
3. Check whether that artifact has already passed its review/approval gate — its `review` field (or equivalent approval field) shows `pass`, `approved`, or `complete`.
4. If the gate has passed, scan every field in the `artifacts.<artifact_id>` block for a value that is still the literal string `TBD`, or an empty list (`[]`) / `null` where the artifact's own template expects a populated value (i.e. the field is not legitimately optional).
5. For each stale field found, emit a one-line warning in the command's output:
   ```
   ⚠ status.md still shows `<field>: TBD` for `<artifact_id>` despite review: pass — status may be stale
   ```
   Emit one warning per stale field — do not suppress after the first.
6. After the last warning (only when at least one was emitted), add one closing line offering the repair path:
   ```
   Run /wire:status-sync <release-folder> to reconcile the record (see specs/utils/status_sync.md).
   ```
   The offer is informational only — never block the calling command and never run the sync automatically.
7. If no stale fields are found, the review/approval gate has not yet passed, or `artifact_id` could not be derived: no output, proceed silently.

This check is self-contained within this utility, so every caller gets it automatically without any caller-side changes.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries, and never
   re-order them. A row is appended at the bottom, always. Rewriting the file
   to insert a row in timestamp order is a modification, not an append.
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
6. **Timestamps must not go backwards.** Because rows are appended in the order
   things happened, each row's timestamp is greater than or equal to the row
   above it. A row whose timestamp precedes its predecessor's means either the
   clock moved or a row was inserted out of order; both are record defects.
   `/wire:status-sync` flags them, naming both rows. This does not block any
   command — the log is written either way, and the flag is a repair prompt.
7. **Single writer in orchestrated mode.** When
   `specs/utils/director_operating_model.md`'s operating model is in force,
   only the orchestrating session appends to this file. Lanes write their own
   state files and the orchestrator writes the log rows from them (rule 6 of
   the operating model). Outside orchestrated mode, every command writes its
   own row as it always has.

## Legacy five-column rows

Logs written before the `By` and `Session` columns existed have four data
columns. They stay valid and are never rewritten:

- A reader parses columns positionally and treats a missing `By` or `Session`
  as unknown. It does not treat a five-column row as malformed and does not
  backfill it.
- The two columns are added on the next write. A file whose header still has
  four columns gets the new header written once, at the point the first
  six-column row is appended; existing rows are left as they are, so a log can
  legitimately hold both shapes.
- Nothing derives meaning from the absence of the columns. An old row is not
  "typed"; it is unknown.
