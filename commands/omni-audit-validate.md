# Omni Audit — Validate

## Purpose

Checks the Omni audit for completeness and internal consistency: every view has a migration approach and complexity, warehouse dependencies are mapped with a coverage metric, every tile is classified as topic-backed or raw-SQL, every raw-SQL tile is scanned and given its own approach, connections are recorded, and the model/content counts match the source. Produces a PASS/FAIL report with specific gaps to address before review.

## Prerequisites

- `audit/omni_audit.md` exists (omni_audit generate: complete)

## Inputs

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/omni_audit.md`
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/status.md`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load the audit

Read `audit/omni_audit.md`. Confirm it is non-empty and contains the expected sections (Summary, Model Catalog, Content Hierarchy, Connection Inventory, Warehouse Dependency Map, Raw-SQL Tile Catalog, Unresolved Views, Unresolved Raw-SQL Tiles, Excluded Content).

### Step 2: Run validation checks

**Check 1 — All views have a migration approach**
Every row in the model catalog has a value in `migration_approach` (repoint / rewrite_sql / rebuild).
PASS/FAIL with views missing an approach.

**Check 2 — All views have a complexity rating**
Every row has a `complexity` value (Low / Medium / High).
PASS/FAIL with views missing complexity.

**Check 3 — Source objects resolved across sql_type, coverage reported**
Source-object resolution is attempted for every view regardless of `sql_type`. Each view with a resolvable source has ≥1 entry in `warehouse_objects`; each genuinely unresolvable view is marked `source_resolved: false` and listed under "Unresolved views". The coverage metric (`resolved_view_count` / `active_view_count`) is present, and status.md carries `resolved_view_count`, `unresolved_view_count`, and `source_resolution_coverage_pct`.
PASS: resolution attempted for all sql_types, coverage present, every unresolved view listed.
FAIL: views left blank without being listed, or coverage metric missing.

**Check 4 — dbt model views cross-referenced**
Every view whose resolved source is a dbt model has a note confirming whether that model exists in the dbt audit (or is out of scope).
PASS/FAIL with views missing the cross-reference.

**Check 5 — Connections documented**
Every distinct `connection_id` referenced by a view appears in the connection inventory with its engine.
PASS/FAIL.

**Check 6 — Every tile classified, raw-SQL tiles scanned**
Every tile in the content hierarchy has a `query_surface` value (`topic` or `raw_sql`). Every `raw_sql` tile has been scanned for source-dialect constructs (`::`, `FLATTEN`, `QUALIFY`, `IFF`, `NVL`, `CONVERT_TIMEZONE`, variant `:` paths) and has a `sql_summary`.
PASS/FAIL with tiles missing a query_surface value or an unscanned raw-SQL tile.

**Check 7 — Raw-SQL tiles have a migration approach, unresolved tiles listed**
Every `raw_sql` tile has a `migration_approach` (repoint / rewrite_sql / rebuild) distinct from `inherits_via_model`. Each raw-SQL tile with a resolvable source has ≥1 entry in `warehouse_objects`; each unresolvable one is marked `source_resolved: false` and listed under "Unresolved raw-SQL tiles" — never dropped.
PASS/FAIL with tiles missing an approach or an unlisted unresolved tile.

**Check 8 — Archived/unused content has a decision**
Every archived or unused workbook/tile has either `include_in_migration: false` with a decommission reason, or `include_in_migration: true` with a note.
PASS/FAIL with undecided content.

**Check 9 — Model and content counts match source**
The counts of connections, topics, views, folders, workbooks, and tiles in the audit tables match `connection_count`, `topic_count`, `view_count`, `folder_count`, `workbook_count`, and `tile_count` in status.md.
PASS/FAIL with mismatched counts.

### Step 3: Write validation report

Append a `## Validation` section to `audit/omni_audit.md` with a per-check PASS/FAIL table and a "Gaps to address" list.

### Step 4: Update status

```yaml
artifacts:
  omni_audit:
    validate: pass | fail
    validated_date: "{{TODAY}}"
```

### Step 5: Output next command

If PASS:
```
/wire:omni-audit-review $ARGUMENTS
```

If FAIL:
```
Validation failed. Address the gaps listed above, then re-run:
/wire:omni-audit-validate $ARGUMENTS
```


## Post-Execution Hooks

After updating `status.md`, run these in sequence:

1. **Execution log** — Append one row to `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/execution_log.md` following `specs/utils/execution_log.md`.

2. **Jira sync** — Follow `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `omni_audit` as artifact, `validate` as action.

3. **Document store** — Follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `omni_audit` as artifact_id, `Omni Audit` as artifact_name, and the `file` value from `artifacts.omni_audit` in status.md as file_path.

4. **Auto-commit** — Follow `specs/utils/commit.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as release_folder, `omni_audit` as artifact, `validate` as action.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
