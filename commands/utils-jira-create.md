# Create Jira Epic and issues for a project

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command

## Tracing (opt-in, off by default)

# Tracing — Detailed, Opt-In, Step-Level Execution Trace

## Purpose

`execution_log.md` records one terse row per whole command (timestamp, command, result, a detail string capped at 120 characters). That's enough for a normal audit trail, but it can't answer "what actually happened inside that command, step by step" — which specific files it read, what it inferred, what it proposed, what a consultant decided, why. Tracing exists for engagements that want that depth: a complete, structured, append-only record of every step of every command, scoped to the release and release type it ran under.

**Off by default.** Tracing never runs unless `WIRE_TRACE=true` is set in the shell environment. If it isn't, skip this entire section — do nothing, check nothing further, proceed straight to the Workflow Specification exactly as if this section didn't exist. This is the common case and must add zero overhead.

## Where it writes

`.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl` — one JSON object per line (JSON Lines), append-only, alongside that release's `status.md` and `execution_log.md`.

For commands not scoped to a specific release (cross-cutting utilities with `release_types: []` in their own front-matter, or any command whose argument isn't a release folder), write to `.wire/trace.jsonl` at the engagement level instead, with `release` and `release_type` fields set to `null`.

This file is **local only** — nothing in it is ever sent anywhere, unlike the anonymous Segment telemetry event described elsewhere. It stays on the consultant's machine, inside the engagement's own repo, exactly like `execution_log.md`.

## What to log, and when

If `WIRE_TRACE=true`:

1. **Resolve context once, before anything else**: the release folder (from this command's own argument, if it has one) and `release_type` (read `.wire/releases/<release_folder>/status.md`'s `project_type` or `release_type` field). If this command has no release-folder argument, both are `null`.
2. **Emit a `command_start` event** before beginning the Workflow Specification below.
3. **As you work through the Workflow Specification's own numbered steps, emit a `step` event after completing each one** — and where a step itself has meaningfully distinct numbered sub-parts (e.g. "check location A, then location B, then infer a match, then propose it"), treat each of those as its own step event too rather than collapsing them into one. The `detail` field has no length limit and is not a summary — write what actually happened: values found, files read, decisions made and why, what was proposed and what the consultant chose. If this step involved the data model registry or any other external/optional resource, log it explicitly: whether it was reached, what was searched, what matched (or didn't, and why not), and whether/how the result was used downstream.
4. **Emit a `command_end` event** when the workflow finishes, with the same `result` value this command would write to `execution_log.md` (`complete`, `pass`, `fail`, `approved`, etc.).

## How to emit an event

Use this pattern for every event (adjust the heredoc body and the Python literals per call — this is a template, not a fixed script):

```bash
[ "${WIRE_TRACE:-false}" = "true" ] && {
  mkdir -p ".wire/releases/<release_folder>" 2>/dev/null
  cat > "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt" << 'WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF'
<the full, untruncated detail text for this event — safe to include quotes,
newlines, code snippets, anything; this heredoc is not shell-interpreted>
WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF
  python3 -c "
import json, datetime
detail = open('/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt').read().rstrip('\n')
event = {
    'ts': datetime.datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'),
    'release': '<release_folder_or_null>',
    'release_type': '<release_type_or_null>',
    'command': 'utils-jira-create',
    'event': '<command_start|step|command_end>',
    'step': '<step_number_or_null>',
    'step_name': '<step_heading_or_null>',
    'result': '<result_value_or_null>',
    'detail': detail,
}
with open('.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl', 'a') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(event) + chr(10))
"
  rm -f "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt"
}
```

- `<release_folder_or_null>` / `<release_type_or_null>`: from Step 1 above; write the literal JSON `null` (no quotes) if either doesn't apply, or a quoted string if it does.
- `event`: `command_start`, `step`, or `command_end`.
- `step` / `step_name`: `null` for `command_start`/`command_end`; the step's own number (e.g. `"1.5"`) and heading (e.g. `"Check for a Canonical Vertical Match"`) for a `step` event.
- `result`: `null` except on `command_end`.
- Adjust the file path in the final `open(...)` call to `.wire/trace.jsonl` for engagement-level (non-release-scoped) commands.

## Rules

1. **Never block or fail the workflow.** If a trace write fails for any reason (disk full, permissions), continue the workflow regardless — trace failures are never surfaced to the user and never stop anything.
2. **Append only** — never rewrite or delete existing lines in `trace.jsonl`.
3. **This is additive to `execution_log.md` and Telemetry, not a replacement for either.** All three continue exactly as documented elsewhere; tracing is a separate, optional, much finer-grained record for engagements that opt in.
4. **Don't summarize into brevity.** The entire point of this mechanism over `execution_log.md` is that it isn't limited to a 120-character line — write the real detail.

# Jira Issue Creation and Linking Utility

## Purpose

Set up Jira tracking for a data platform project. Supports two modes:

- **Create mode**: Create a new Jira issue hierarchy (Epic → Tasks → Sub-tasks) from scratch
- **Link mode**: Search an existing Jira project for issues that match framework artifacts and link to them instead of creating duplicates

Can be used in three ways:
- **During project creation**: Called automatically from `/wire:new` (Step 9.5) when the user opts in to Jira tracking
- **Mid-project enablement**: Run standalone on an existing project to retroactively add Jira tracking at any point
- **Linking to existing boards**: When a Jira project already has issues (e.g. in a running sprint), search and link to the most appropriate existing issues

## Usage

```bash
/wire:utils-jira-create YYYYMMDD_project_name
```

When invoked standalone (not from `/wire:new`), prompt the user for the Jira project key and the desired mode (create or link).

## Prerequisites

- Atlassian MCP server must be configured
- Jira project key must be provided
- Project must exist with a valid `status.md`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read Project Context

**Process**:
1. Read the project's `status.md`
2. Extract from YAML frontmatter:
   - `project_name`
   - `client_name`
   - `project_type`
   - `artifacts` section (to determine in-scope artifacts)
3. Accept `jira_project_key` from the calling context (provided by user during `/wire:new`), or if running standalone, ask the user directly:
   ```
   What is the Jira project key? (e.g., DP, ACME, PROJ)
   ```

### Step 1.5: Determine Workflow Mode and Structure

The setup is parameterised by two dimensions:

- **`jira_mode`**: `create` (build the issue hierarchy from scratch) or `link` (find and link to existing issues already in a Jira project).
- **`jira_structure`**: `subtasks` (default — one Task per artifact + three Sub-tasks per artifact for generate / validate / review) or `single_issue` (one Task per artifact, no Sub-tasks; the Task moves through workflow states as commands run).

**If invoked from `/wire:new` with `jira_mode: "link"`**:
- Proceed to **Step 2A** (Search for Existing Issues). The `link` mode currently assumes `subtasks` structure (linking to issues that have their own Sub-tasks).

**If invoked from `/wire:new` with `jira_mode: "create"` and `jira_structure: "single_issue"`**:
- Proceed to **Step 2** (Create Epic), then take the **Single-issue branch** in Step 3 (one Task per artifact, no Sub-tasks).

**If invoked from `/wire:new` with `jira_mode: "create"` and `jira_structure: "subtasks"` (or no structure specified — backwards compatible default)**:
- Proceed to **Step 2** (Create Epic), then take the **Sub-tasks branch** in Step 3 (existing behaviour: one Task per artifact + three Sub-tasks).

**If invoked standalone** (not from `/wire:new`):
- After getting the Jira project key in Step 1, use `AskUserQuestion`:

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "How would you like to set up Jira tracking?",
    "header": "Jira Mode",
    "options": [
      {"label": "Create — sub-tasks per command", "description": "Epic → Task per artifact → 3 Sub-tasks (generate / validate / review). Default."},
      {"label": "Create — single issue per artifact", "description": "Epic → Task per artifact. The Task moves through To Do → In Progress (generate) → In Review (validate) → Done (review approved). Requires workflow support for those four states."},
      {"label": "Link to existing issues", "description": "Search for and link to existing issues in this Jira project (sub-tasks structure assumed)"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
}
```

Store `jira_mode` and `jira_structure` accordingly:
- "Create — sub-tasks per command" → `mode: create`, `structure: subtasks`
- "Create — single issue per artifact" → `mode: create`, `structure: single_issue`
- "Link to existing issues" → `mode: link`, `structure: subtasks`

### Step 1.6: Pre-flight workflow check (single_issue structure only)

If `jira_structure: single_issue` is selected, verify the Jira project's workflow supports the four required states: **To Do**, **In Progress**, **In Review**, **Done**. Use the Atlassian MCP to inspect available transitions on any existing issue in the project; if all four states are reachable, proceed. If any state is missing, output:

```
The Jira project [PROJECT_KEY] does not appear to support the workflow states required for single_issue structure: To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done.

Options:
1. Add the missing states / transitions to the Jira workflow and re-run.
2. Re-run /wire:new and choose "Create — sub-tasks per command" instead.
3. If your workflow uses different state names (e.g. "In QA" instead of "In Review"), tell me the names and I'll map them.
```

Wait for user input before proceeding.

---

## Workflow Path A: Create New Issues (Existing)

### Step 2: Create Epic

Create the top-level Epic for the project:

```
createJiraIssue:
  projectKey: "[jira_project_key]"
  issueType: "Epic"
  summary: "[client_name] - [project_name] Data Platform"
  description: |
    Data Platform project for [client_name].

    **Project Type**: [project_type]
    **Created**: [date]

    ## Artifacts in Scope
    [List of in-scope artifacts]

    ## Tracking
    Local status: .wire/[folder_name]/status.md
```

Record the returned Epic key (e.g., `PROJ-123`).

### Step 3: Create Tasks for Each In-Scope Artifact

For each artifact where the state is NOT `not_applicable`, create a Task under the Epic.

**Artifact display names and descriptions**:

| Artifact | Task Summary | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| requirements | Requirements Specification | Extract and validate requirements from SOW |
| workshops | Workshops | Discovery and clarification workshops |
| conceptual_model | Conceptual Model | Entity model and business object relationships |
| pipeline_design | Pipeline Design | Data pipeline architecture and data flow diagram |
| data_model | Data Model Design | dbt model structure (staging/integration/warehouse) |
| mockups | Dashboard Mockups | Dashboard wireframes and UX mockups |
| pipeline | Data Pipeline | Pipeline implementation code |
| dbt | dbt Models | dbt model SQL and configuration |
| semantic_layer | Semantic Layer | LookML views, explores, and measures |
| dashboards | Dashboards | Dashboard implementation |
| data_quality | Data Quality Tests | Data quality validation and testing |
| uat | User Acceptance Testing | UAT plan and execution |
| deployment | Deployment | Production deployment artifacts |
| training | Training Materials | Training sessions and materials |
| documentation | Documentation | Technical and user documentation |

For each in-scope artifact:

```
createJiraIssue:
  projectKey: "[jira_project_key]"
  issueType: "Task"
  summary: "[Artifact Display Name]: [project_name]"
  description: "[Description from table above]"
  parentKey: "[epic_key]"
```

Record each returned Task key.

### Step 4: Sub-tasks or single issue — branch on `jira_structure`

#### Step 4a — `jira_structure: single_issue` (one Task per artifact)

Skip Sub-task creation. Instead, store only the Task key in status.md and ensure each Task starts in the **To Do** workflow state.

For each Task created in Step 3:

1. Verify the Task is in **To Do** state. If newly created it should be (Jira's default starting state). If not, transition it back to To Do.
2. Record only `task_key` in status.md under `jira.artifacts.[artifact]` — leave `generate_key`, `validate_key`, `review_key` as `null` (the Sub-tasks don't exist in this structure).
3. Also record `structure: single_issue` at the top of the `jira` section.

Skip to Step 5 (Update status.md).

The single Task will move through workflow states as commands run, per the state-transition matrix in `wire/specs/utils/jira_sync.md`:

| Command result | Transitions Task to |
|---|---|
| `<artifact>-generate` completes | **In Progress** |
| `<artifact>-validate` passes | **In Review** |
| `<artifact>-validate` fails | **In Progress** (kept, with comment) |
| `<artifact>-review` approved | **Done** |
| `<artifact>-review` changes_requested | **In Progress** |

The Jira project's workflow must support those four states. The pre-flight check in Step 1.6 verified this.

#### Step 4b — `jira_structure: subtasks` (default — one Task + three Sub-tasks per artifact)

For each Task, create Sub-tasks for the applicable lifecycle steps. Not all artifacts have all three steps (e.g., workshops and mockups have no validate step).

**Lifecycle steps per artifact**:

| Artifact | Generate | Validate | Review |
|----------|----------|----------|--------|
| requirements | yes | yes | yes |
| workshops | yes | no | yes |
| conceptual_model | yes | yes | yes |
| pipeline_design | yes | yes | yes |
| data_model | yes | yes | yes |
| mockups | yes | no | yes |
| pipeline | yes | yes | yes |
| dbt | yes | yes | yes |
| semantic_layer | yes | yes | yes |
| dashboards | yes | yes | yes |
| data_quality | yes | yes | yes |
| uat | yes | no | yes |
| deployment | yes | yes | yes |
| training | yes | yes | yes |
| documentation | yes | yes | yes |

For each applicable step:

```
createJiraIssue:
  projectKey: "[jira_project_key]"
  issueType: "Sub-task"
  summary: "[Step]: [Artifact Display Name]"
  description: "[Step] the [artifact] for [project_name]"
  parentKey: "[task_key]"
```

Example Sub-tasks for Requirements:
- `Generate: Requirements Specification`
- `Validate: Requirements Specification`
- `Review: Requirements Specification`

Record each returned Sub-task key.

---

## Workflow Path B: Link to Existing Issues

### Step 2A: Search for Existing Issues

Search the Jira project for issues that could map to framework artifacts. Use `searchJiraIssuesUsingJql` with a tiered strategy:

**Query 1 — Epics in the project:**
```
searchJiraIssuesUsingJql:
  jql: "project = [jira_project_key] AND issuetype = Epic ORDER BY created DESC"
  maxResults: 20
```

**Query 2 — Tasks/Stories in active sprint:**
```
searchJiraIssuesUsingJql:
  jql: "project = [jira_project_key] AND issuetype in (Task, Story) AND sprint in openSprints() ORDER BY created DESC"
  maxResults: 50
```

**Query 3 — Fallback: all open Tasks/Stories (if Query 2 returns no results or project doesn't use sprints):**
```
searchJiraIssuesUsingJql:
  jql: "project = [jira_project_key] AND issuetype in (Task, Story) AND status != Done ORDER BY created DESC"
  maxResults: 50
```

If Query 2 returns results, use those (sprint-scoped). If not, use Query 3 (all open issues). This handles Scrum, Kanban, and no-sprint projects.

Note to user if falling back:
```
No active sprint found in [KEY]. Searching all open issues.
```

### Step 2B: Match Issues to Framework Artifacts

For each in-scope artifact, find the best matching Jira issue from the search results using a scored matching algorithm.

**Scoring rules:**

| Signal | Score | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Summary contains artifact display name | +10 | e.g., "Requirements Specification" in issue summary |
| Summary contains artifact keyword | +5 | e.g., "requirements", "dbt", "pipeline" |
| Summary contains project name or client name | +3 | Indicates project relevance |
| Description contains artifact keywords | +2 | Weaker signal from description text |
| Issue type matches expected (Task for artifacts) | +2 | Type alignment |
| Issue is in active sprint | +1 | Recency/relevance bonus |

**Minimum threshold**: 5 points. Issues scoring below 5 are not considered matches.

**Assignment**: Process artifacts in descending order of their best match score. Each Jira issue can only be matched to one artifact (no double-matching). If two artifacts would match the same issue, the higher-scoring match wins and the lower-scoring artifact tries its next-best candidate.

**Artifact keyword mapping:**

| Artifact | Display Name | Match Keywords |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| requirements | Requirements Specification | "requirements", "scope", "SOW", "deliverables" |
| workshops | Workshops | "workshop", "discovery", "kickoff" |
| conceptual_model | Conceptual Model | "entities", "conceptual", "ERD" |
| pipeline_design | Pipeline Design | "pipeline", "architecture", "data flow" |
| data_model | Data Model Design | "dbt", "staging", "warehouse", "data model" |
| mockups | Dashboard Mockups | "mockup", "wireframe", "dashboard design" |
| pipeline | Data Pipeline | "pipeline", "extraction", "data pipeline" |
| dbt | dbt Models | "dbt", "models", "transformations" |
| semantic_layer | Semantic Layer | "LookML", "semantic", "metrics", "measures" |
| dashboards | Dashboards | "dashboard", "report", "visualization" |
| data_quality | Data Quality Tests | "data quality", "testing", "dbt test" |
| uat | User Acceptance Testing | "UAT", "user acceptance", "sign-off" |
| deployment | Deployment | "deployment", "go-live", "production" |
| training | Training Materials | "training", "enablement", "onboarding" |
| documentation | Documentation | "documentation", "runbook", "handover" |

**Epic matching:**
- If an Epic's summary contains the client name or project name, match it as the project Epic
- If multiple Epics match, present them to the user for selection
- If no Epic matches, mark as "no Epic match" — `epic_key` will be null in status.md

**Sub-task matching** — For each matched Task, retrieve its Sub-tasks:
```
searchJiraIssuesUsingJql:
  jql: "parent = [task_key] AND issuetype = Sub-task ORDER BY created ASC"
  maxResults: 20
```

Match Sub-tasks to lifecycle steps using keyword detection in the Sub-task summary:
- **generate_key**: Summary contains "Generate", "Create", "Build", "Develop", or "Write"
- **validate_key**: Summary contains "Validate", "Test", "Check", "Verify", or "QA"
- **review_key**: Summary contains "Review", "Approve", "Sign-off", or "Accept"

If Sub-task names don't contain recognisable keywords, present them to the user:
```
Sub-tasks found under [PROJ-45] "[Task summary]":
1. [PROJ-46] "Write initial draft" — Map to: Generate? Validate? Review? Skip?
2. [PROJ-47] "QA check" — Map to: Generate? Validate? Review? Skip?
```

**Classify each artifact:**
- **Matched**: Task found (score >= 5) and at least one Sub-task mapped
- **Partial match**: Task found but no or incomplete Sub-task matches
- **No match**: No candidate Task scored above the threshold

### Step 2C: Present Matches for User Confirmation

Display the proposed mapping to the user:

```markdown
## Proposed Jira Issue Mapping

**Epic**: [PROJ-123] "[Epic summary]" → Project Epic
  (or: "No matching Epic found — epic_key will be left empty")

### Artifact Mapping

| Artifact | Jira Issue | Score | Sub-tasks Found | Status |
|----------|-----------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| Requirements | PROJ-45 "Requirements Doc" | 15 | Gen: PROJ-46, Val: PROJ-47, Rev: PROJ-48 | Matched |
| dbt Models | PROJ-50 "dbt Development" | 12 | Gen: PROJ-51, Val: PROJ-52 | Partial (missing Review) |
| Dashboards | PROJ-55 "Build Dashboards" | 8 | — | Partial (no sub-tasks) |
| Data Quality | — | — | — | No match |

### Summary
- **Matched**: [count] artifacts fully matched
- **Partial**: [count] artifacts partially matched
- **Unmatched**: [count] artifacts with no match
```

Then ask the user for confirmation using `AskUserQuestion`:

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "How would you like to proceed with this mapping?",
    "header": "Confirm Linking",
    "options": [
      {"label": "Accept all matches", "description": "Link matched issues and create new issues for anything unmatched or missing"},
      {"label": "Accept matches only", "description": "Link matched issues, skip unmatched artifacts (no new issues created)"},
      {"label": "Let me adjust", "description": "Walk through each artifact and specify which issue to link"},
      {"label": "Cancel", "description": "Don't set up Jira tracking"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
}
```

### Step 2D: Execute Linking

Based on the user's response:

**"Accept all matches":**
1. Record all matched issue keys (Epic, Tasks, Sub-tasks) for status.md
2. For **unmatched artifacts**: create new Tasks and Sub-tasks under the matched Epic (using the same creation logic from Steps 3 and 4). If no Epic was matched, create a new Epic first (using Step 2).
3. For **partial matches** (Task matched but some Sub-tasks missing): create only the missing Sub-tasks under the matched Task

**"Accept matches only":**
1. Record all matched issue keys for status.md
2. Leave unmatched artifacts with null keys in status.md (they can be linked or created later by re-running this utility)
3. For partial matches, record what was found and leave missing Sub-task keys as null

**"Let me adjust":**
For each in-scope artifact, ask the user directly in chat:
```
For [Artifact Display Name]:
- Suggested match: [PROJ-45] "[Summary]" (score: 15)
- Type a different issue key (e.g., PROJ-99) to link to that issue instead
- Type "skip" to leave unlinked
- Type "create" to create a new issue
```
For any manually specified issue key, fetch it with `getJiraIssue` to verify it exists and retrieve its Sub-tasks. Then apply Sub-task matching as in Step 2B.

**"Cancel":**
- Skip Jira integration entirely
- Continue to Step 10 of `/wire:new` (or exit if standalone)

### Step 2E: Add Linking Comments

For each **linked** issue (not newly created ones — those are handled by the creation path), add a comment to provide an audit trail in Jira:

**Comment on linked Epic:**
```
addCommentToJiraIssue:
  issueKey: "[epic_key]"
  body: |
    Linked to Wire Framework project: [project_name]
    Client: [client_name] | Type: [project_type]
    Local tracking: .wire/[folder_name]/status.md

    This Epic is now being tracked by the Wire Framework.
    Status updates will be synced automatically.
```

**Comment on each linked Task:**
```
addCommentToJiraIssue:
  issueKey: "[task_key]"
  body: |
    Linked to Wire Framework artifact: [Artifact Display Name]
    Project: [project_name]

    This task is now tracked by the Wire Framework.
    Sub-task transitions will be synced automatically.
```

Skip comments on newly created issues (they already have descriptions from the creation step).

### Step 2F: Proceed to Common Steps

After the linking workflow completes, proceed to:
- **Step 5** (Update status.md with Jira Keys) — same YAML structure as creation mode
- **Step 5.5** (Sync Existing Progress) — transitions linked issues to match current artifact states
- **Step 6** (Report Results) — uses the linking report format (see below)

**Linking report format** (used instead of the creation report when issues were linked):

```markdown
## Jira Issues Linked

**Epic**: [PROJ-123] "[Epic summary]"
**Linked**: [count] artifact tasks (from existing issues)
**Created**: [count] artifact tasks (new issues for unmatched artifacts)
**Sub-tasks linked**: [count]
**Sub-tasks created**: [count]

### Issue Hierarchy

| Artifact | Task | Source | Generate | Validate | Review |
|----------|------|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| Requirements | PROJ-45 | Linked | PROJ-46 (L) | PROJ-47 (L) | PROJ-48 (L) |
| dbt Models | PROJ-50 | Linked | PROJ-51 (L) | PROJ-52 (L) | PROJ-60 (C) |
| Data Quality | PROJ-61 | Created | PROJ-62 (C) | PROJ-63 (C) | PROJ-64 (C) |

**(L) = Linked to existing issue, (C) = Created new issue**

All issue keys have been recorded in status.md.
```

## Step 4.5: Sprint Assignment (Both Paths)

After creating or linking all Tasks and Sub-tasks, assign them to a sprint on the project's board.

### 4.5.1: Find the Board

Use the Atlassian MCP to find the board for this Jira project:

```
fetch:
  method: GET
  url: "/rest/agile/1.0/board?projectKeyOrId=[jira_project_key]"
```

Extract the first `boardId` from the response. If no board is found, log `"Note: No Jira board found for project [jira_project_key]. Skipping sprint assignment."` and proceed to Step 5.

### 4.5.2: Check for Existing Sprints

Query for active and future sprints on the board:

```
fetch:
  method: GET
  url: "/rest/agile/1.0/board/{boardId}/sprint?state=active,future"
```

### 4.5.3: Determine Sprint

- If an **active sprint** exists: use it (store `sprintId` and `sprint_name`)
- If no active sprint but a **future sprint** exists: use the future sprint (will be started in Step 4.5.5)
- If **no sprints** exist: create a new sprint:

```
jiraWrite:
  method: POST
  url: "/rest/agile/1.0/sprint"
  body:
    name: "[client_name] — [project_name]"
    boardId: [boardId]
    startDate: "[today ISO format]"
    endDate: "[today + 14 days ISO format]"
```

Store the returned `sprintId` and `sprint_name`.

### 4.5.4: Move Issues into Sprint

Move all Task-level issue keys into the sprint (Sub-tasks inherit from their parent):

```
jiraWrite:
  method: POST
  url: "/rest/agile/1.0/sprint/{sprintId}/issue"
  body:
    issues:
      - "[task_key_1]"
      - "[task_key_2]"
      - ...
```

### 4.5.5: Start Sprint (if not active)

If the sprint used in Step 4.5.3 is not already active (i.e., it was a future or newly created sprint), start it:

```
jiraWrite:
  method: POST
  url: "/rest/agile/1.0/sprint/{sprintId}"
  body:
    state: "active"
    startDate: "[today ISO format]"
    endDate: "[today + 14 days ISO format]"
```

### 4.5.6: Handle Edge Cases

- **Kanban board** (no sprints concept): Skip sprint assignment silently — issues will appear on the Kanban board automatically
- **Sprint API fails**: Log `"Note: Could not assign issues to sprint. Issues are created in backlog."` and continue — do not block the workflow
- **Board has multiple active sprints**: Use the most recently created active sprint

Store `sprint_name` for inclusion in the Step 6 report.

---

## Common Steps (Both Paths)

### Step 5: Update status.md with Jira Keys

Update the project's `status.md` YAML frontmatter with all created issue keys:

```yaml
jira:
  project_key: "PROJ"
  epic_key: "PROJ-123"
  artifacts:
    requirements:
      task_key: "PROJ-124"
      generate_key: "PROJ-125"
      validate_key: "PROJ-126"
      review_key: "PROJ-127"
    data_model:
      task_key: "PROJ-128"
      generate_key: "PROJ-129"
      validate_key: "PROJ-130"
      review_key: "PROJ-131"
    # ... (all in-scope artifacts)
```

For out-of-scope artifacts, omit them from the jira.artifacts section entirely.

### Step 5.5: Sync Existing Progress (Mid-Project Only)

If this utility is running on a project that already has progress (i.e., some artifacts have `generate: complete`, `validate: pass`, or `review: approved`):

1. After writing Jira keys to status.md, call the full reconciliation workflow in `specs/utils/jira_status_sync.md`
2. This transitions all Sub-tasks to match the existing local artifact states
3. For example, if requirements are already generated and validated, the `Generate: Requirements` and `Validate: Requirements` Sub-tasks will be transitioned to "Done"

This ensures the Jira board immediately reflects the project's actual state rather than showing all Sub-tasks as "To Do".

### Step 6: Report Results

**Output**:

```markdown
## Jira Issues Created

**Epic**: [PROJ-123] [client_name] - [project_name] Data Platform
**Tasks**: [count] artifact tasks
**Sub-tasks**: [count] lifecycle step sub-tasks
**Sprint**: [sprint_name] ([active/started])

### Issue Hierarchy

| Artifact | Task | Generate | Validate | Review |
|----------|------|----------|----------|--------|
| Requirements | PROJ-124 | PROJ-125 | PROJ-126 | PROJ-127 |
| Data Model | PROJ-128 | PROJ-129 | PROJ-130 | PROJ-131 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

All issue keys have been recorded in status.md.
```

### Step 7: Handle Edge Cases

**Atlassian MCP not available:**
```
Note: Could not connect to Jira (Atlassian MCP server not configured).
Skipping Jira issue creation. You can create issues later by running:
/wire:utils-jira-create [folder]
```

**Epic creation fails:**
```
Error: Failed to create Jira Epic. Check that:
- Project key "[key]" exists in Jira
- You have permission to create issues
- The Epic issue type is available in this project

Skipping Jira issue creation. Project created without Jira tracking.
```

**Partial creation failure:**
If some Tasks or Sub-tasks fail to create:
1. Record successfully created issue keys in status.md
2. Report which issues failed
3. Suggest manual creation or retry

**Jira already configured:**
If `status.md` already has a `jira.epic_key`:
```
Jira tracking is already configured for this project.

Epic: [PROJ-123] - [project_name]

Do you want to:
1. Keep existing Jira tracking (no changes)
2. Replace with new Jira issues (create from scratch)
3. Re-link to different existing issues (search again)
```

**Linking-specific edge cases:**

**No issues found in project:**
```
No existing issues found in Jira project [KEY].

Would you like to create new issues instead?
```
If yes, switch to the creation workflow (Step 2 onwards).

**No active sprint:**
- Fall back to searching all non-Done issues (Query 3)
- Note: "No active sprint found. Searching all open issues."

**Ambiguous matches (multiple issues score equally for one artifact):**
Present the top 2-3 candidates to the user:
```
Multiple possible matches for [Artifact]:
1. [PROJ-45] "Requirements Document" (score: 12)
2. [PROJ-50] "Project Requirements" (score: 12)
3. None of these — create new

Which one?
```

**Issues already in "Done" state:**
- Matched issues in "Done" status are still linkable
- Show the current Jira status in the confirmation table so the user can decide
- The `jira_status_sync.md` workflow handles state mapping correctly regardless of current issue state

**Jira uses "Story" instead of "Task":**
- The JQL queries search both: `issuetype in (Task, Story)`
- Stories are treated as Task equivalents for matching purposes

In all cases, project creation continues — Jira tracking is optional and additive.

## Output

This utility:
- **Create mode**: Creates Jira Epic + Tasks + Sub-tasks for the project
- **Link mode**: Searches existing Jira issues, matches them to framework artifacts, and links to them (creating only what's missing)
- Updates `status.md` with all issue keys (same format regardless of mode)
- If run mid-project, syncs existing artifact progress to linked/created issues
- Reports the issue hierarchy with linked vs created indicators
- Fails gracefully if Jira is unavailable
- Can be run at any point in the project lifecycle

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise

## Example
