# Validate relocated carve-out dbt models — files present, predicates re-derived from disk, target compiles

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command
- `specs/<path>.md` references are shared workflow docs shipped with this plugin — read them from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/specs/<path>.md`. If the path matches a Wire command (e.g. `specs/requirements/generate.md`), it means that command (`/wire:requirements-generate`) and its spec is already embedded in the command file.

## Tracing (opt-in, off by default)

description: Internal utility — opt-in step-level execution tracing to .wire/releases/<release>/trace.jsonl when WIRE_TRACE=true

# Tracing — Detailed, Opt-In, Step-Level Execution Trace

## Purpose

`execution_log.md` records one terse row per whole command (timestamp, command, result, a detail string capped at 120 characters). That's enough for a normal audit trail, but it can't answer "what actually happened inside that command, step by step" — which specific files it read, what it inferred, what it proposed, what a consultant decided, why. Tracing exists for engagements that want that depth: a complete, structured, append-only record of every step of every command, scoped to the release and release type it ran under.

**Off by default.** Tracing never runs unless `WIRE_TRACE=true` is set in the shell environment. If it isn't, skip this entire section — do nothing, check nothing further, proceed straight to the Workflow Specification exactly as if this section didn't exist. This is the common case and must add zero overhead.

## Where it writes

`.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl` — one JSON object per line (JSON Lines), append-only, alongside that release's `status.md` and `execution_log.md`.

For commands not scoped to a specific release (cross-cutting utilities with `release_types: []` in their own front-matter, or any command whose argument isn't a release folder), write to `.wire/trace.jsonl` at the engagement level instead, with `release` and `release_type` fields set to `null`.

This file is **local only** — nothing in it is ever sent anywhere, unlike the anonymous Segment telemetry event described elsewhere. It stays on the consultant's machine, inside the engagement's own repo, exactly like `execution_log.md`.

## What to log, and when

If `WIRE_TRACE=true`:

1. **Resolve context once, before anything else**: the release folder (from this command's own argument, if it has one) and `release_type` (read `.wire/releases/<release_folder>/status.md`'s `project_type` or `release_type` field). If this command has no release-folder argument, both are `null`.
2. **Emit a `command_start` event** before beginning the Workflow Specification below.
3. **As you work through the Workflow Specification's own numbered steps, emit a `step` event after completing each one** — and where a step itself has meaningfully distinct numbered sub-parts (e.g. "check location A, then location B, then infer a match, then propose it"), treat each of those as its own step event too rather than collapsing them into one. The `detail` field has no length limit and is not a summary — write what actually happened: values found, files read, decisions made and why, what was proposed and what the consultant chose. If this step involved the data model registry or any other external/optional resource, log it explicitly: whether it was reached, what was searched, what matched (or didn't, and why not), and whether/how the result was used downstream.
4. **Emit a `command_end` event** when the workflow finishes, with the same `result` value this command would write to `execution_log.md` (`complete`, `pass`, `fail`, `approved`, etc.).

## How to emit an event

Use this pattern for every event (adjust the heredoc body and the Python literals per call — this is a template, not a fixed script):

```bash
[ "${WIRE_TRACE:-false}" = "true" ] && {
  mkdir -p ".wire/releases/<release_folder>" 2>/dev/null
  cat > "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt" << 'WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF'
<the full, untruncated detail text for this event — safe to include quotes,
newlines, code snippets, anything; this heredoc is not shell-interpreted>
WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF
  python3 -c "
import json, datetime
detail = open('/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt').read().rstrip('\n')
event = {
    'ts': datetime.datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'),
    'release': '<release_folder_or_null>',
    'release_type': '<release_type_or_null>',
    'command': 'dbt-carveout-relocate-validate',
    'event': '<command_start|step|command_end>',
    'step': '<step_number_or_null>',
    'step_name': '<step_heading_or_null>',
    'result': '<result_value_or_null>',
    'detail': detail,
}
with open('.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl', 'a') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(event) + chr(10))
"
  rm -f "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt"
}
```

- `<release_folder_or_null>` / `<release_type_or_null>`: from Step 1 above; write the literal JSON `null` (no quotes) if either doesn't apply, or a quoted string if it does.
- `event`: `command_start`, `step`, or `command_end`.
- `step` / `step_name`: `null` for `command_start`/`command_end`; the step's own number (e.g. `"1.5"`) and heading (e.g. `"Check for a Canonical Vertical Match"`) for a `step` event.
- `result`: `null` except on `command_end`.
- Adjust the file path in the final `open(...)` call to `.wire/trace.jsonl` for engagement-level (non-release-scoped) commands.

## Rules

1. **Never block or fail the workflow.** If a trace write fails for any reason (disk full, permissions), continue the workflow regardless — trace failures are never surfaced to the user and never stop anything.
2. **Append only** — never rewrite or delete existing lines in `trace.jsonl`.
3. **This is additive to `execution_log.md` and Telemetry, not a replacement for either.** All three continue exactly as documented elsewhere; tracing is a separate, optional, much finer-grained record for engagements that opt in.
4. **Don't summarize into brevity.** The entire point of this mechanism over `execution_log.md` is that it isn't limited to a 120-character line — write the real detail.

# dbt Carveout Relocate — Validate

## Purpose

Validates a `dbt-carveout-relocate-generate` run. Every check re-derives its answer independently from the adjudicated CSV and the files actually on disk under `--target-dbt-project-path` — it does not trust the manifest's (`dbt_carveout_relocate_manifest.md`, or `_{wave_id}.md` under `--wave`) own claims about what it did.

## Flags

- `--wave <id>` / `--batch N` / `--select <selector>` — same scope this generate run was invoked with; resolved identically (see `dbt-carveout-relocate-generate` Step 1). If omitted, validate every model recorded under `artifacts.dbt_carveout_relocate` in status.md across all prior runs for this release.
- `--target-dbt-project-path <path>` — **required.** The dbt project relocated models were written into.

## Validation Checks

Read `migration/region_tags_adjudicated.csv`, filter to `item_type == "dbt_model" AND adjudicated_ruling == "carve_in"`, intersected with the resolved scope — this is the ground-truth set every check below validates against, independent of what the manifest claims was relocated.

**Check 1 — Every carve_in model resolves to a file that exists**
For every model in the ground-truth set, confirm the corresponding `.sql` file exists under `--target-dbt-project-path` at the expected mirrored path.
PASS: every model has a file. FAIL: list models with no file — a silent drop during relocation.

**Check 2 — Every shared-row-level model actually contains the injected predicate**
For every model in the ground-truth set with `bucket == shared-row-level` whose `predicate_injection` is `injected`, read the relocated `.sql` file directly and independently confirm it contains a `WHERE` clause carrying that model's filter **from its registry row** (`migration/tenant_predicate_registry.csv`, not `migration.tenant_predicate` — from v3.11.3 the filter is per model) on the outermost `SELECT`. Do not read this from the manifest's own claim; re-derive it from the file text. Strip SQL comments before re-deriving, for the same reason generate does: a commented-out filter is not a filter.
PASS: filter confirmed present in the file for every such model. FAIL: list models where the manifest claims injection but the file doesn't show it (or shows it on the wrong query level).

**Check 2b — Inherited models carry no filter, and their resolving node does (v3.11.3)**
For every model whose `predicate_injection` is `not_applicable_inherited`, confirm two things independently of the manifest: the relocated file contains no injected filter, and the registry row's `resolving_node` names an item whose own registry row carries a mechanism other than `unresolved`. Follow `resolving_node` transitively and confirm the chain terminates — an inheritance chain that loops, or that ends at an unresolved node, means the model is unscoped while claiming to be resolved.
PASS: every inherited model's chain terminates at a resolved node. FAIL: name the model, the chain walked, and where it broke.

**Check 2c — Registry completeness and internal consistency (v3.11.3)**
Run the registry-wide checks in `specs/utils/tenant_predicate_registry.md` over `migration/tenant_predicate_registry.csv`: one row per `carve_in` item; expression present exactly for `row_predicate`/`derived_expr`/`account_cascade` and empty for the rest; `inherited` rows resolving to something; no inheritance cycle; `verified_date` accompanied by `provenance`; every non-empty expression well-formed (balanced parentheses, closed quotes, no dangling `{{`, per that spec's well-formedness check, #200).
PASS: all six hold. FAIL: list each violation with its row. A `malformed_expression` violation blocks like the rest (fail, not warn): a truncated expression parses as a valid row while carrying half a rule.

**Check 2d — Derived predicates carry a recorded semantics check (#219)**
For every injected model whose registry row is derived (`resolved_by` other than `adjudication`/`manual`, mechanism with a `tenant_column`), confirm the row records a semantics-check result (the measured `distinct_values`/`tenant_share` figures and a verdict in `provenance`/`notes`, with `verified_date` set) per `specs/utils/tenant_predicate_registry.md`. A row whose recorded verdict is `implausible_zero_share` or `implausible_dispersed` must not have been injected at all.
PASS: every derived injected row carries a recorded `plausible` verdict. FAIL: list rows injected with no recorded check, and any row injected over an implausible verdict (the worse of the two: a filter applied against its own evidence).

**Check 2e — SCD-shaped models carry the entity-grain form (#219)**
Independently re-classify every relocated model against the SCD-shape signals in `specs/utils/tenant_predicate_registry.md` (snapshot materialisation, `dbt_valid_from`/`dbt_valid_to`, a `valid_from`+`valid_to` pair, an `is_current` flag), from the relocated file and its companion YAML, not from the manifest. For every SCD-shaped model with an injected predicate, confirm the injected form is entity grain (a semi-join over the entity key), not the raw row expression.
PASS: every SCD-shaped injected model carries the entity-grain form. FAIL: name each SCD-shaped model carrying a row-grain predicate; a row-grain predicate on a history table truncates version history silently.

**Check 2f — Expected-empty markers present and reasoned (#219)**
For every model the manifest records as `expected_empty: true`, confirm the relocated file's first line is the `-- EXPECTED EMPTY (<tenant>): ...` header and that the header carries a non-empty reason with the measured source figures. Conversely, a file carrying the marker must appear in the manifest's expected-empty list.
PASS: markers and manifest agree, every marker reasoned. FAIL: list models with a missing, reason-less, or manifest-orphaned marker.

**Check 3 — No confident-region model carries an injected predicate**
For every model in the ground-truth set with `bucket == confident-region`, confirm its relocated `.sql` file does **not** contain a `WHERE` clause referencing `migration.tenant_predicate` that wasn't already present in the source file. A predicate showing up on a `confident-region` model indicates a bucket misclassification upstream (in `region-tagging-generate`/`-review`), not something this command should silently accept.
PASS: no unexpected predicate found. FAIL: list models with an unexpected predicate, flagged for region-tagging re-adjudication, not for re-running this command.

**Check 4 — Manual-review-required list is empty, or every entry is explicitly signed off**
Read the manifest's manual-review-required list. For each entry, confirm either it no longer applies (the file has since been hand-edited and Check 2 now passes for it) or `dbt-carveout-relocate-review` recorded an explicit sign-off for that specific model (see that spec's Step 3).
PASS: list is empty, or every entry has a matching sign-off record. FAIL: list any entry with neither.

**Check 4b — Proposed dispositions are not treated as rulings (v3.11.3)**
For every registry row with `resolved_by: row_distribution_probe` and `confidence: medium` (a Rung 4 proposal), confirm `dbt-carveout-relocate-review` recorded a ruling for it. A proposal is evidence for a decision, not the decision, and a model shipped on one has been scoped by a query nobody approved.
PASS: every proposal has a ruling, or there are none. FAIL: list each unruled proposal with its evidence query.

**Check 5 — Target project compiles cleanly**
Run `dbt parse` (or `dbt compile`) against `--target-dbt-project-path` for the ground-truth model set, via the same scratch-directory pattern as generate's Step 4.
PASS: all models compile without errors. FAIL: list compilation errors per model.

**Check 6 — Every sources.yml entry is read by at least one enabled model (#219)**
Parse every `sources.yml` (and any `*.yml` declaring `sources:`) under `--target-dbt-project-path`, and build the set of `source()` references across the project's enabled models (from the compiled manifest, or a comment-stripped scan of the model files). Every declared source table entry must be read by at least one enabled model.
**The rule is fail-on-any: one unread entry fails the check**, with every unread entry listed (`<source_name>.<table_name>`, defining file). A sources.yml copied verbatim from the parent project carries entries no model in the new project reads (547 of 631 on the engagement that motivated this check), and each unread entry is a wrong answer somewhere else: freshness checks on tables the project never uses, lineage that claims reads that do not happen, and data-protection (DPIA) answers derived from a source list that overstates what the project touches. Sources accrue with the models that read them: an entry a later wave will need belongs in that wave's relocation, not copied ahead.
PASS: zero unread entries. FAIL: list every unread entry.
Tests mirror the unread-entry derivation (`wire/tests/platform_migration/validate_carveout_hygiene.py`).

**Check 7 — Every enabled model resolves to an explicitly configured dataset/schema (#219)**
For every enabled model, resolve its target dataset/schema the way dbt does: in-file `{{ config(schema=...) }}`, companion YAML config, or a `+schema` on a configured path in `dbt_project.yml`. Every model must resolve through at least one explicit configuration. A model that falls through to the profile default (typically a model sitting at the project root, outside every configured path) would materialise into a stray default dataset (`_unset` or the profile's own) in the sovereign project.
PASS: every enabled model's dataset/schema traces to an explicit config. FAIL: name each model resolving to the profile default, with its path and the configured paths it falls outside.
Tests mirror the fall-through classification (`wire/tests/platform_migration/validate_carveout_hygiene.py`).

### Update status

```yaml
artifacts:
  dbt_carveout_relocate:
    validate: pass | fail
    validated_date: "{{TODAY}}"
    wave_validate:                # set only when run with --wave, keyed by wave id
      B01: pass | fail
```


## Post-Execution Hooks

After updating `status.md`, run these in sequence:

1. **Execution log** — Append one row to `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/execution_log.md` following `specs/utils/execution_log.md`.

2. **Jira sync** — Follow `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `dbt_carveout_relocate` as artifact, `validate` as action.

3. **Document store** — Follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `dbt_carveout_relocate` as artifact_id, `dbt Carveout Relocate` as artifact_name, and the `file` value from `artifacts.dbt_carveout_relocate` in status.md as file_path.

4. **Auto-commit** — Follow `specs/utils/commit.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as release_folder, `dbt_carveout_relocate` as artifact, `validate` as action.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

---
description: Internal utility — appends a log entry to the project's execution log after any generate/validate/review workflow or skill activation
---

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail | By | Session |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|----|---------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> | <by> | <session> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition, or an advisory gate satisfied by a director's ruling
  - `mode` — the director handed control over or took it back ("you drive" / "I'll drive"), per `specs/utils/director_operating_model.md`
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason
  - For a ruling-satisfied advisory gate: the precondition and the ruling id
- **By**: the git user (`git config user.name`), or `unknown` if git has no
  user configured. Who the run is attributable to, regardless of what typed it.
- **Session**: what invoked the run. One of:
  - `typed` — a person typed the command
  - `orchestrator` — the orchestrating session dispatched it, followed by its
    session id in brackets where one is available: `orchestrator [a1b2c3]`
  - a lane label — the lane that ran it, e.g. `dbt-developer [staging 1/2]`
  - `autopilot` — `/wire:autopilot` ran it

  This is the same value the `invoked_by` telemetry property carries
  (`specs/utils/telemetry.md`), read from `WIRE_INVOKED_BY` and defaulting to
  `typed`. The log records it per row so the record on disk answers the same
  question telemetry answers in aggregate.

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> | <by> | <session> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Stale Status Check

Immediately after appending a **command** row (this does not apply to skill activation entries), perform a quick freshness check against the project's `status.md`. This is additive to the logging behavior above — it never blocks the calling command and never modifies `status.md`.

**Process**:
1. Derive `artifact_id` from the command just logged: strip the `/wire:` prefix and the trailing `-generate`, `-validate`, or `-review` suffix (e.g. `/wire:migration-inventory-generate` → `migration_inventory`). If the command doesn't map to a recognizable artifact (e.g. `/wire:new`, `/wire:status`, `/wire:archive`), skip this check entirely.
2. Read the artifact's own block in `status.md`: `artifacts.<artifact_id>`.
3. Check whether that artifact has already passed its review/approval gate — its `review` field (or equivalent approval field) shows `pass`, `approved`, or `complete`.
4. If the gate has passed, scan every field in the `artifacts.<artifact_id>` block for a value that is still the literal string `TBD`, or an empty list (`[]`) / `null` where the artifact's own template expects a populated value (i.e. the field is not legitimately optional).
5. For each stale field found, emit a one-line warning in the command's output:
   ```
   ⚠ status.md still shows `<field>: TBD` for `<artifact_id>` despite review: pass — status may be stale
   ```
   Emit one warning per stale field — do not suppress after the first.
6. After the last warning (only when at least one was emitted), add one closing line offering the repair path:
   ```
   Run /wire:status-sync <release-folder> to reconcile the record (see specs/utils/status_sync.md).
   ```
   The offer is informational only — never block the calling command and never run the sync automatically.
7. If no stale fields are found, the review/approval gate has not yet passed, or `artifact_id` could not be derived: no output, proceed silently.

This check is self-contained within this utility, so every caller gets it automatically without any caller-side changes.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries, and never
   re-order them. A row is appended at the bottom, always. Rewriting the file
   to insert a row in timestamp order is a modification, not an append.
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
6. **Timestamps must not go backwards.** Because rows are appended in the order
   things happened, each row's timestamp is greater than or equal to the row
   above it. A row whose timestamp precedes its predecessor's means either the
   clock moved or a row was inserted out of order; both are record defects.
   `/wire:status-sync` flags them, naming both rows. This does not block any
   command — the log is written either way, and the flag is a repair prompt.
7. **Single writer in orchestrated mode.** When
   `specs/utils/director_operating_model.md`'s operating model is in force,
   only the orchestrating session appends to this file. Lanes write their own
   state files and the orchestrator writes the log rows from them (rule 6 of
   the operating model). Outside orchestrated mode, every command writes its
   own row as it always has.

## Legacy five-column rows

Logs written before the `By` and `Session` columns existed have four data
columns. They stay valid and are never rewritten:

- A reader parses columns positionally and treats a missing `By` or `Session`
  as unknown. It does not treat a five-column row as malformed and does not
  backfill it.
- The two columns are added on the next write. A file whose header still has
  four columns gets the new header written once, at the point the first
  six-column row is appended; existing rows are left as they are, so a log can
  legitimately hold both shapes.
- Nothing derives meaning from the absence of the columns. An old row is not
  "typed"; it is unknown.
