# Kickoff Deck — Review

## Purpose

Conducts an internal review of the kick-off deck before it is presented to the client. Surfaces meeting context from Fathom (if available), collects reviewer feedback, records the review outcome, and on approval instructs the consultant how to export the PDF.

## Inputs

- Engagement-level: `.wire/kickoff-deck.html`
- Release-enriched: `.wire/releases/<release-folder>/artifacts/kickoff-deck.html`

`kickoff_deck.validate` must be `complete`. If not: stop — "Run `/wire:kickoff-validate` first."

## Workflow

### Step 1: Locate the deck file

Resolve in order:
1. If `<release-folder>` supplied: `.wire/releases/<release-folder>/artifacts/kickoff-deck.html`
2. Else: `.wire/kickoff-deck.html`

Read the EDITMODE block. Extract `clientName`, `engagementType`, and `presenters` for the review header.

### Step 2: Surface meeting context (Fathom)

Attempt to retrieve Fathom meeting context via the meeting context utility (`wire/specs/utils/meeting_context.md`). Search for recent meetings related to the kickoff or scoping discussion with this client.

If Fathom is available and meetings are found, surface:
- Any client-stated priorities or expectations from scoping calls
- Any concerns or preferences about the kick-off format
- Any changes to team composition or timeline mentioned since the SoW

If Fathom is unavailable, proceed without — note this in the review header.

### Step 3: Present the review summary

Display:

```
KICKOFF DECK INTERNAL REVIEW
Client: [clientName]
Engagement type: [engagementType]
Deck: [file path]
Presenters: [names and roles]

Slide-by-slide content summary:
  Slide 01 (Title):    [clientName] — [engagementDate]
  Slide 04 (Diagnosis): [first 80 chars of slide4LeftCache or "EMPTY"]
  Slide 05 (Metric):   [slide5Number][slide5Suffix] — [slide5Bold or "EMPTY"]
  Slide 07 (Problems): [slide6Count] problems
  Slide 09 (Outcomes): [slide8Count] outcomes
  Slide 11 (Architecture): [slide10Headline or "EMPTY"]
  Slide 13 (Timeline): W1 — [slide12W1Focus or "EMPTY"] / W2 — [slide12W2Focus or "EMPTY"]
  Slide 15 (Access):   [slide14Count] categories
  Slide 16 (Team):     [presenter count] presenter(s)

[Fathom context, if available]
```

### Step 4: Collect reviewer feedback

Ask:

```
Please review the deck at [file path] in your browser, then answer:

1. Are all slides accurate and complete?
2. Are there any content changes needed before presenting?
3. Is the presenter list correct?
4. Approved to export as PDF and present?

Enter feedback, or type "approved" to record approval.
```

### Step 5: Handle feedback

**If changes are needed**:
- Record the feedback verbatim
- Set `kickoff_deck.review: "in_progress"` in status
- Instruct consultant: "Update the EDITMODE block in [file path] using the tweaks panel or by editing the JSON directly, then re-run `/wire:kickoff-validate` and `/wire:kickoff-review`."

**If approved**:
- Set `kickoff_deck.review: "complete"` in status
- Record the reviewer name and date in status

### Step 6: PDF export instructions (on approval)

```
✅ KICKOFF DECK APPROVED

To export as PDF, run one of the following:

macOS (Google Chrome):
  "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" \
    --headless \
    --print-to-pdf="kickoff.pdf" \
    --print-to-pdf-no-header \
    "file://$PWD/[deck-path]"

macOS (Chromium via Homebrew):
  /opt/homebrew/bin/chromium \
    --headless \
    --print-to-pdf="kickoff.pdf" \
    --print-to-pdf-no-header \
    "file://$PWD/[deck-path]"

Linux / CI:
  chromium --headless --no-sandbox \
    --print-to-pdf="kickoff.pdf" \
    --print-to-pdf-no-header \
    "file://$PWD/[deck-path]"

If the architecture diagram (slide 11) appears blank in the PDF, add:
  --virtual-time-budget=5000

Fallback (interactive browser):
  Open [deck-path] in Chrome → Cmd+P (Mac) or Ctrl+P (Linux/Windows)
  → Destination: Save as PDF → Layout: Landscape → Margins: None → Background graphics: ON

The PDF will be saved to the current working directory. Move it alongside the HTML:
  mv kickoff.pdf [deck-dir]/kickoff-deck.pdf
```

### Step 7: Sync to issue tracker

If Jira or Linear are configured, update the kickoff_deck sub-issue/task to "Done".

## Status transitions

| Outcome | `review` field |
|---------|---------------|
| Changes requested | `in_progress` |
| Approved | `complete` |

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise

## Example

```markdown
