# Enumerate all databases, schemas, tables, views on source platform

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command
- `specs/<path>.md` references are shared workflow docs shipped with this plugin — read them from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/specs/<path>.md`. If the path matches a Wire command (e.g. `specs/requirements/generate.md`), it means that command (`/wire:requirements-generate`) and its spec is already embedded in the command file.

## Tracing (opt-in, off by default)

---
description: Internal utility — opt-in step-level execution tracing to .wire/releases/<release>/trace.jsonl when WIRE_TRACE=true
---

# Tracing — Detailed, Opt-In, Step-Level Execution Trace

## Purpose

`execution_log.md` records one terse row per whole command (timestamp, command, result, a detail string capped at 120 characters). That's enough for a normal audit trail, but it can't answer "what actually happened inside that command, step by step" — which specific files it read, what it inferred, what it proposed, what a consultant decided, why. Tracing exists for engagements that want that depth: a complete, structured, append-only record of every step of every command, scoped to the release and release type it ran under.

**Off by default.** Tracing never runs unless `WIRE_TRACE=true` is set in the shell environment. If it isn't, skip this entire section — do nothing, check nothing further, proceed straight to the Workflow Specification exactly as if this section didn't exist. This is the common case and must add zero overhead.

## Where it writes

`.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl` — one JSON object per line (JSON Lines), append-only, alongside that release's `status.md` and `execution_log.md`.

For commands not scoped to a specific release (cross-cutting utilities with `release_types: []` in their own front-matter, or any command whose argument isn't a release folder), write to `.wire/trace.jsonl` at the engagement level instead, with `release` and `release_type` fields set to `null`.

This file is **local only** — nothing in it is ever sent anywhere, unlike the anonymous Segment telemetry event described elsewhere. It stays on the consultant's machine, inside the engagement's own repo, exactly like `execution_log.md`.

## What to log, and when

If `WIRE_TRACE=true`:

1. **Resolve context once, before anything else**: the release folder (from this command's own argument, if it has one) and `release_type` (read `.wire/releases/<release_folder>/status.md`'s `project_type` or `release_type` field). If this command has no release-folder argument, both are `null`.
2. **Emit a `command_start` event** before beginning the Workflow Specification below.
3. **As you work through the Workflow Specification's own numbered steps, emit a `step` event after completing each one** — and where a step itself has meaningfully distinct numbered sub-parts (e.g. "check location A, then location B, then infer a match, then propose it"), treat each of those as its own step event too rather than collapsing them into one. The `detail` field has no length limit and is not a summary — write what actually happened: values found, files read, decisions made and why, what was proposed and what the consultant chose. If this step involved the data model registry or any other external/optional resource, log it explicitly: whether it was reached, what was searched, what matched (or didn't, and why not), and whether/how the result was used downstream.
4. **Emit a `command_end` event** when the workflow finishes, with the same `result` value this command would write to `execution_log.md` (`complete`, `pass`, `fail`, `approved`, etc.).

## How to emit an event

Use this pattern for every event (adjust the heredoc body and the Python literals per call — this is a template, not a fixed script):

```bash
[ "${WIRE_TRACE:-false}" = "true" ] && {
  mkdir -p ".wire/releases/<release_folder>" 2>/dev/null
  cat > "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt" << 'WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF'
<the full, untruncated detail text for this event — safe to include quotes,
newlines, code snippets, anything; this heredoc is not shell-interpreted>
WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF
  python3 -c "
import json, datetime
detail = open('/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt').read().rstrip('\n')
event = {
    'ts': datetime.datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'),
    'release': '<release_folder_or_null>',
    'release_type': '<release_type_or_null>',
    'command': 'db-object-audit-generate',
    'event': '<command_start|step|command_end>',
    'step': '<step_number_or_null>',
    'step_name': '<step_heading_or_null>',
    'result': '<result_value_or_null>',
    'detail': detail,
}
with open('.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl', 'a') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(event) + chr(10))
"
  rm -f "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt"
}
```

- `<release_folder_or_null>` / `<release_type_or_null>`: from Step 1 above; write the literal JSON `null` (no quotes) if either doesn't apply, or a quoted string if it does.
- `event`: `command_start`, `step`, or `command_end`.
- `step` / `step_name`: `null` for `command_start`/`command_end`; the step's own number (e.g. `"1.5"`) and heading (e.g. `"Check for a Canonical Vertical Match"`) for a `step` event.
- `result`: `null` except on `command_end`.
- Adjust the file path in the final `open(...)` call to `.wire/trace.jsonl` for engagement-level (non-release-scoped) commands.

## Rules

1. **Never block or fail the workflow.** If a trace write fails for any reason (disk full, permissions), continue the workflow regardless — trace failures are never surfaced to the user and never stop anything.
2. **Append only** — never rewrite or delete existing lines in `trace.jsonl`.
3. **This is additive to `execution_log.md` and Telemetry, not a replacement for either.** All three continue exactly as documented elsewhere; tracing is a separate, optional, much finer-grained record for engagements that opt in.
4. **Don't summarize into brevity.** The entire point of this mechanism over `execution_log.md` is that it isn't limited to a 120-character line — write the real detail.

## Automatic Validation (on by default)

---
description: Internal utility — injected auto-validate section so generate commands run their matching validate step automatically and fold the result into their output
---

Every `generate` command that has a matching `validate` command for the
same artifact runs that validate step automatically as part of generate —
by default, with no separate command to remember. This section only appears
on commands where that applies; artifacts with no separate validate step at
all (e.g. mockups, workshops, UAT) never carry this section.

## Step: Check `auto_validate`

Read this command's own `auto_validate` front-matter field, in the Workflow
Specification below. Two states:

- **Absent, or `true`** (the default — most artifacts): auto-validate runs.
- **`false`**: this artifact's validate step is expensive — it runs real
  code, queries a live warehouse or BI tool, or otherwise does IO beyond
  re-reading local files — so it does not run automatically. Skip to
  "If `auto_validate: false`" below.

## If `auto_validate` is absent or `true`: run validate automatically

Once this command finishes writing its artifact, before ending:

1. Run this artifact's own `/wire:<artifact-with-dashes>-validate` workflow
   in full, exactly as if the consultant had typed it themselves — same
   inputs, same `status.md` write to `artifacts.<artifact>.validate`, same
   report. This is not optional or an extra step layered on top; it is the
   default behavior for this artifact.
2. Fold the result into this command's own closing output rather than
   presenting it as a separate command run:
   - **PASS** — add a single closing line: `✅ Auto-validated — PASS`. The
     full report already went to `status.md`/`execution_log.md`, exactly as
     it would from a standalone validate run — no need to repeat it here.
   - **FAIL** — surface the validate command's own failure report in full,
     exactly as running validate standalone would show it, so the
     consultant sees what's wrong immediately without running anything
     else themselves.
3. This never blocks or undoes generate itself — the artifact is written
   either way, and its content is never rolled back because validate
   failed. Auto-validation only means validate has already run and its
   result is already on record by the time generate finishes, instead of
   waiting for the consultant to remember to run it separately.

## If `auto_validate` is `false`: state this plainly, don't run it

Do not run validate. End with a line naming why, as specifically as this
spec's own context makes possible (e.g. "runs `dbt run`/`dbt test`",
"queries the live target warehouse", "calls the Looker API directly") —
fall back to "performs live checks against an external system" only if no
more specific reason is evident from context:

```
⚠ This artifact's validate step [reason] and does not run automatically.
Run /wire:<artifact-with-dashes>-validate <release_folder> before
requesting review — review is blocked until it passes.
```

## Why this is always safe either way

`review` already requires `validate: PASS` for this same artifact as one of
its own declared preconditions (see `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md`) —
this is existing, independent enforcement, not something added by this
section. So an `auto_validate: false` opt-out never lets an artifact reach
review unvalidated; it only decides *when* the consultant pays validate's
cost — automatically on every draft (the default), or once, on their own
schedule, before requesting review (the opt-out). Auto-validation is a
convenience that closes the "forgot to run it" gap for the common case; the
gate that actually prevents unvalidated work from being reviewed was already
there.

# DB Object Audit — Generate

## Purpose

Catalogs every database object on the source platform — databases, schemas, tables, views, materialized views, external tables, and stored procedures. Classifies each object by type, owner, row volume tier, and migration approach. The output feeds into the migration inventory and target setup DDL generation.

## Prerequisites

- Release folder with `release_type: platform_migration` in `status.md`
- Source platform credentials or MCP server access configured
- For Snowflake: the Snowflake MCP server (`mcp__claude_ai_Snowflake__sql_exec`) connected and reachable — verify with `/mcp` before starting

## Inputs

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/status.md` — source platform (`bigquery` or `snowflake`)
- Source platform MCP or direct SQL access

## Workflow

### Step 1: Locate the release

Confirm `release_type: platform_migration`. Read `migration.source_platform`.

If the audit file already exists at `audit/db_object_audit.md`, ask whether to re-generate or update.

### Step 2: Query source platform object catalog

**If source is BigQuery**:

```sql
-- All tables and views across all datasets
SELECT
  table_catalog AS project,
  table_schema AS dataset,
  table_name,
  table_type,
  row_count,
  size_bytes,
  creation_time,
  last_modified_time,
  ddl
FROM `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
ORDER BY table_catalog, table_schema, table_name;
```

Also query:
- `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ROUTINES` for stored procedures and UDFs
- `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEWS` for view definitions
- `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS` to identify partitioned tables

**If source is Snowflake**:

All queries below run via `mcp__claude_ai_Snowflake__sql_exec`. `ACCOUNT_USAGE` has up to 45-minute latency — use it for full-estate counts. Use `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` for precise, real-time DDL on specific objects. Always pair `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` on `ACCOUNT_USAGE` queries.

```sql
-- All tables, views, materialized views, external tables
SELECT
  TABLE_CATALOG,
  TABLE_SCHEMA,
  TABLE_NAME,
  TABLE_TYPE,
  ROW_COUNT,
  BYTES,
  CREATED,
  LAST_ALTERED,
  COMMENT
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.TABLES
WHERE DELETED IS NULL
ORDER BY TABLE_CATALOG, TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME;
```

```sql
-- Stored procedures
SELECT
  PROCEDURE_CATALOG,
  PROCEDURE_SCHEMA,
  PROCEDURE_NAME,
  ARGUMENT_SIGNATURE,
  PROCEDURE_LANGUAGE,
  PROCEDURE_DEFINITION,
  CREATED,
  LAST_ALTERED
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.PROCEDURES
WHERE DELETED IS NULL
ORDER BY PROCEDURE_CATALOG, PROCEDURE_SCHEMA, PROCEDURE_NAME;
```

```sql
-- UDFs and UDTFs
SELECT
  FUNCTION_CATALOG,
  FUNCTION_SCHEMA,
  FUNCTION_NAME,
  ARGUMENT_SIGNATURE,
  DATA_TYPE AS RETURN_TYPE,
  FUNCTION_LANGUAGE,
  FUNCTION_DEFINITION,
  IS_TABLE_FUNCTION,
  CREATED,
  LAST_ALTERED
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.FUNCTIONS
WHERE DELETED IS NULL
ORDER BY FUNCTION_CATALOG, FUNCTION_SCHEMA, FUNCTION_NAME;
```

```sql
-- Stages (internal, named external, user)
SELECT
  STAGE_CATALOG,
  STAGE_SCHEMA,
  STAGE_NAME,
  STAGE_URL,
  STAGE_REGION,
  STAGE_TYPE,
  CREATED,
  LAST_ALTERED,
  COMMENT
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.STAGES
WHERE DELETED IS NULL
ORDER BY STAGE_CATALOG, STAGE_SCHEMA, STAGE_NAME;
```

```sql
-- Dynamic tables (incremental refresh, no direct BigQuery equivalent)
SELECT
  NAME,
  DATABASE_NAME,
  SCHEMA_NAME,
  TARGET_LAG,
  SCHEDULING_STATE,
  REFRESH_MODE,
  ROWS,
  BYTES,
  CREATED,
  LAST_ALTERED
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.DYNAMIC_TABLES
WHERE DELETED IS NULL
ORDER BY DATABASE_NAME, SCHEMA_NAME, NAME;
```

```sql
-- Streams (CDC changelog — no direct BigQuery equivalent)
SELECT
  STREAM_NAME,
  STREAM_SCHEMA_NAME,
  STREAM_DATABASE_NAME,
  TABLE_NAME,
  STALE,
  MODE,
  STALE_AFTER,
  CREATED
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.STREAMS
WHERE DELETED IS NULL
ORDER BY STREAM_DATABASE_NAME, STREAM_SCHEMA_NAME, STREAM_NAME;
```

```sql
-- Tasks (scheduled SQL / stored procedure calls — replace with Cloud Scheduler / Airflow on target)
SELECT
  NAME,
  DATABASE_NAME,
  SCHEMA_NAME,
  SCHEDULE,
  STATE,
  DEFINITION,
  CONDITION,
  LAST_COMMITTED_ON,
  LAST_SUSPENDED_ON
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.TASKS
WHERE DELETED IS NULL
ORDER BY DATABASE_NAME, SCHEMA_NAME, NAME;
```

```sql
-- Pipes (Snowpipe continuous ingest — replace with target-platform streaming ingestion)
SELECT
  PIPE_CATALOG,
  PIPE_SCHEMA,
  PIPE_NAME,
  DEFINITION,
  CREATED,
  LAST_ALTERED
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.PIPES
WHERE DELETED IS NULL
ORDER BY PIPE_CATALOG, PIPE_SCHEMA, PIPE_NAME;
```

```sql
-- Row access policies (security — must be recreated on target)
SELECT
  POLICY_CATALOG,
  POLICY_SCHEMA,
  POLICY_NAME,
  POLICY_BODY,
  CREATED,
  LAST_ALTERED
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.ROW_ACCESS_POLICIES
WHERE DELETED IS NULL;
```

```sql
-- Masking policies (column-level security — must be recreated on target)
SELECT
  POLICY_CATALOG,
  POLICY_SCHEMA,
  POLICY_NAME,
  POLICY_BODY,
  CREATED,
  LAST_ALTERED
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.MASKING_POLICIES
WHERE DELETED IS NULL;
```

```sql
-- Outbound data shares (note: cannot be migrated — must be rebuilt on target)
SHOW SHARES;
```

For each view and stored procedure, retrieve the full DDL via `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` (lower latency than `ACCOUNT_USAGE`):

```sql
SELECT GET_DDL('VIEW', 'my_db.my_schema.my_view');
SELECT GET_DDL('PROCEDURE', 'my_db.my_schema.my_proc(NUMBER, VARCHAR)');
SELECT GET_DDL('FUNCTION', 'my_db.my_schema.my_udf(VARCHAR)');
```

To identify semantic views (Cortex Analyst layer — if present, these require special handling):

```sql
SHOW SEMANTIC VIEWS IN DATABASE my_db;
```

If any semantic views are found, tag them as a separate object type (`semantic_view`) in the audit. The semantic layer definition must be re-authored on the target platform — it cannot be translated directly.

### Step 3: Classify each object

For each object, assign:

**Object type classification**:
- `table` — standard managed table
- `view` — non-materialised view
- `materialized_view` — materialised/precomputed view
- `external_table` — table backed by external storage
- `udf` — user-defined function (scalar or table-valued)
- `stored_procedure` — stored procedure
- `stage` — Snowflake internal or external stage (no direct target equivalent)
- `dynamic_table` — Snowflake incremental refresh table (no direct BigQuery equivalent; evaluate per case)
- `stream` — Snowflake CDC stream (replace with target streaming ingestion)
- `task` — Snowflake scheduled SQL/procedure (replace with Airflow, Cloud Scheduler, or dbt Cloud)
- `pipe` — Snowpipe continuous ingest definition (replace with target ingestion service)
- `semantic_view` — Cortex Analyst semantic layer view (must be re-authored on target; not translatable)
- `row_access_policy` — row-level security policy (must be recreated on target)
- `masking_policy` — column-level masking policy (must be recreated on target)
- `share` — outbound Snowflake data share (cannot be migrated; note for stakeholder decision)

**Row volume tier**:
- `xs` — <1M rows
- `s` — 1M–100M rows
- `m` — 100M–1B rows
- `l` — 1B–10B rows
- `xl` — >10B rows

**Migration approach**:
- `recreate_ddl` — re-create DDL on target, load data via Fivetran or COPY
- `translate_view` — translate view SQL to target dialect
- `evaluate` — requires manual assessment before a migration approach can be assigned; applies to: external tables, UDFs, stored procedures, dynamic tables, streams, tasks, pipes, semantic views, masking/row-access policies, shares
- `exclude` — staging/temp tables, scratch schemas, system objects, transient tables used only for intermediate processing

Default approach by Snowflake object type when source is Snowflake:

| Object type | Default approach | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `table` | `recreate_ddl` | Standard tables; data load via Fivetran or COPY |
| `view` | `translate_view` | SQL requires dialect translation |
| `materialized_view` | `evaluate` | Target-platform MV capabilities differ |
| `external_table` | `evaluate` | Stage location, format, and IAM must be assessed |
| `udf` | `evaluate` | Language-specific (JS/Python/Java/SQL); assess portability |
| `stored_procedure` | `evaluate` | High complexity; often needs rewrite |
| `stage` | `evaluate` | Cloud storage paths and credentials need remapping |
| `dynamic_table` | `evaluate` | No direct BigQuery equivalent; consider dbt incremental |
| `stream` | `evaluate` | Replace with target CDC service |
| `task` | `evaluate` | Replace with Airflow/Cloud Scheduler DAGs |
| `pipe` | `evaluate` | Replace with target ingestion connector |
| `semantic_view` | `evaluate` | Must be re-authored as BigQuery/Looker semantic layer |
| `row_access_policy` | `evaluate` | Translate to BigQuery row-level security or equivalent |
| `masking_policy` | `evaluate` | Translate to BigQuery policy tags or equivalent |
| `share` | `evaluate` | Snowflake-specific; stakeholder decision required |

### Step 4: Identify platform-specific features requiring translation

For each view and procedure, scan the definition for features that require dialect translation. Load the feature detection file for the source platform:

- BigQuery source: read `wire/platform_pairs/bigquery_to_snowflake/feature_detection.md`
- Snowflake source: read `wire/platform_pairs/snowflake_to_bigquery/feature_detection.md`

Tag each object with the features detected. These tags drive complexity scoring in the dbt audit and migration strategy.

### Step 5: Write the audit report

**Output location**: `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/db_object_audit.md`

Use the template at `TEMPLATES/migration/db_object_audit.md`. Include:
- Summary counts by object type and volume tier
- Full object catalog table
- Platform-specific feature tags
- Objects flagged as `evaluate` or `exclude` with reasons
- Schema/database inventory (distinct list)

### Step 6: Update status

```yaml
artifacts:
  db_object_audit:
    generate: complete
    file: audit/db_object_audit.md
    generated_date: "{{TODAY}}"
    total_objects: N
    tables: N
    views: N
    materialized_views: N
    external_tables: N
    dynamic_tables: N     # Snowflake only
    streams: N            # Snowflake only
    tasks: N              # Snowflake only
    pipes: N              # Snowflake only
    semantic_views: N     # Snowflake only
    udfs: N
    stored_procedures: N
    stages: N             # Snowflake only
    security_policies: N  # Snowflake row access + masking policies
    shares: N             # Snowflake only
    evaluate_count: N
    exclude_count: N
```

### Step 7: Output summary

Print: total objects cataloged, breakdown by type, count flagged for evaluation or exclusion, and next command:

```
/wire:db-object-audit-validate $ARGUMENTS
```

## Output Files

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/db_object_audit.md`
- Updated `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/status.md`


## Post-Execution Hooks

After updating `status.md`, run these in sequence:

1. **Execution log** — Append one row to `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/execution_log.md` following `specs/utils/execution_log.md`.

2. **Jira sync** — Follow `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `db_object_audit` as artifact, `generate` as action.

3. **Document store** — Follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `db_object_audit` as artifact_id, `DB Object Audit` as artifact_name, and the `file` value from `artifacts.db_object_audit` in status.md as file_path.

4. **Auto-commit** — Follow `specs/utils/commit.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as release_folder, `db_object_audit` as artifact, `generate` as action.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

---
description: Internal utility — appends a log entry to the project's execution log after any generate/validate/review workflow or skill activation
---

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail | By | Session |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|----|---------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> | <by> | <session> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition, or an advisory gate satisfied by a director's ruling
  - `mode` — the director handed control over or took it back ("you drive" / "I'll drive"), per `specs/utils/director_operating_model.md`
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason
  - For a ruling-satisfied advisory gate: the precondition and the ruling id
- **By**: the git user (`git config user.name`), or `unknown` if git has no
  user configured. Who the run is attributable to, regardless of what typed it.
- **Session**: what invoked the run. One of:
  - `typed` — a person typed the command
  - `orchestrator` — the orchestrating session dispatched it, followed by its
    session id in brackets where one is available: `orchestrator [a1b2c3]`
  - a lane label — the lane that ran it, e.g. `dbt-developer [staging 1/2]`
  - `autopilot` — `/wire:autopilot` ran it

  This is the same value the `invoked_by` telemetry property carries
  (`specs/utils/telemetry.md`), read from `WIRE_INVOKED_BY` and defaulting to
  `typed`. The log records it per row so the record on disk answers the same
  question telemetry answers in aggregate.

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> | <by> | <session> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Stale Status Check

Immediately after appending a **command** row (this does not apply to skill activation entries), perform a quick freshness check against the project's `status.md`. This is additive to the logging behavior above — it never blocks the calling command and never modifies `status.md`.

**Process**:
1. Derive `artifact_id` from the command just logged: strip the `/wire:` prefix and the trailing `-generate`, `-validate`, or `-review` suffix (e.g. `/wire:migration-inventory-generate` → `migration_inventory`). If the command doesn't map to a recognizable artifact (e.g. `/wire:new`, `/wire:status`, `/wire:archive`), skip this check entirely.
2. Read the artifact's own block in `status.md`: `artifacts.<artifact_id>`.
3. Check whether that artifact has already passed its review/approval gate — its `review` field (or equivalent approval field) shows `pass`, `approved`, or `complete`.
4. If the gate has passed, scan every field in the `artifacts.<artifact_id>` block for a value that is still the literal string `TBD`, or an empty list (`[]`) / `null` where the artifact's own template expects a populated value (i.e. the field is not legitimately optional).
5. For each stale field found, emit a one-line warning in the command's output:
   ```
   ⚠ status.md still shows `<field>: TBD` for `<artifact_id>` despite review: pass — status may be stale
   ```
   Emit one warning per stale field — do not suppress after the first.
6. After the last warning (only when at least one was emitted), add one closing line offering the repair path:
   ```
   Run /wire:status-sync <release-folder> to reconcile the record (see specs/utils/status_sync.md).
   ```
   The offer is informational only — never block the calling command and never run the sync automatically.
7. If no stale fields are found, the review/approval gate has not yet passed, or `artifact_id` could not be derived: no output, proceed silently.

This check is self-contained within this utility, so every caller gets it automatically without any caller-side changes.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries, and never
   re-order them. A row is appended at the bottom, always. Rewriting the file
   to insert a row in timestamp order is a modification, not an append.
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
6. **Timestamps must not go backwards.** Because rows are appended in the order
   things happened, each row's timestamp is greater than or equal to the row
   above it. A row whose timestamp precedes its predecessor's means either the
   clock moved or a row was inserted out of order; both are record defects.
   `/wire:status-sync` flags them, naming both rows. This does not block any
   command — the log is written either way, and the flag is a repair prompt.
7. **Single writer in orchestrated mode.** When
   `specs/utils/director_operating_model.md`'s operating model is in force,
   only the orchestrating session appends to this file. Lanes write their own
   state files and the orchestrator writes the log rows from them (rule 6 of
   the operating model). Outside orchestrated mode, every command writes its
   own row as it always has.

## Legacy five-column rows

Logs written before the `By` and `Session` columns existed have four data
columns. They stay valid and are never rewritten:

- A reader parses columns positionally and treats a missing `By` or `Session`
  as unknown. It does not treat a five-column row as malformed and does not
  backfill it.
- The two columns are added on the next write. A file whose header still has
  four columns gets the new header written once, at the point the first
  six-column row is appended; existing rows are left as they are, so a log can
  legitimately hold both shapes.
- Nothing derives meaning from the absence of the columns. An old row is not
  "typed"; it is unknown.
