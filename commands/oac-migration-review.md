# Internal RA review of OAC migration runbook

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command

# OAC Migration — Review

## Purpose

Internal RA review of the OAC migration runbook before execution. Confirms physical table and raw SQL construct translations are correct, `manual-review-out-of-scope` items have an agreed owner and are genuinely reauthored rather than skipped, validation is genuinely branch-based via a non-production OAC copy, and the two-stage connection-pool cutover and its per-stage rollback are agreed.

## Prerequisites

- `migration/oac_migration_runbook.md` exists with `validate: pass`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load meeting context

Follow `specs/utils/meeting_context.md`. Search for discussions about OAC, reporting cutover, semantic model owners, or BI access requirements.

### Step 2: Present runbook for review

Summary to present:
- Topology (additive target connection pool + Git branch) and rationale, including the target `databaseType` verification
- Physical tables by approach (repoint / rewrite_sql / rebuild)
- Any SQL translations with non-trivial changes
- `manual-review-out-of-scope` constructs, their required reauthoring, and assigned owners
- The two-stage cutover plan (branch validation via a non-production OAC copy → branch merge + primary connection-pool repoint) and per-stage rollback

### Step 3: Gather reviewer feedback

1. Are the physical table and raw SQL construct translations correct and do they preserve each report's meaning?
2. Are the `rebuild` plans complete for physical tables with no direct translation path?
3. Are the `manual-review-out-of-scope` constructs correctly scoped, and does the client know who owns reauthoring each one against the target connection pool?
4. Is validation genuinely branch-based — is the primary connection pool, and the production OAC environment, confirmed untouched until Stage 2?
5. Is the two-stage cutover agreed, and is each stage's rollback (branch abandon/delete, connection pool details, connection-pool script restore) workable? Who on the client side owns the cutover window and the non-production OAC environment used for validation?

### Step 4: Apply feedback and record decision

```markdown
## Review

**Reviewed by**: {{REVIEWER_NAME}}
**Review date**: {{TODAY}}
**Decision**: approved | changes_requested

### Reviewer notes
[Capture corrections, agreed cutover window, rollback ownership]
```

### Step 5: Update status

```yaml
artifacts:
  oac_migration:
    review: approved | changes_requested
    reviewed_by: "{{REVIEWER_NAME}}"
    reviewed_date: "{{TODAY}}"
```

### Step 6: Output next command

If approved:
```
/wire:equivalency-validate $ARGUMENTS
```


## Post-Execution Hooks

After updating `status.md`, run these in sequence:

1. **Execution log** — Append one row to `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/execution_log.md` following `specs/utils/execution_log.md`.

2. **Jira sync** — Follow `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `oac_migration` as artifact, `review` as action.

3. **Document store** — Follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `oac_migration` as artifact_id, `OAC Migration` as artifact_name, and the `file` value from `artifacts.oac_migration` in status.md as file_path.

4. **Auto-commit** — Follow `specs/utils/commit.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as release_folder, `oac_migration` as artifact, `review` as action.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
