# dbt Migration — Lint (Tier 1 equivalence pre-flight)

## Purpose

A static, offline first pass over translated dbt models that catches the translations which **compile cleanly on the target and still return the wrong answer**. It does not connect to either warehouse and does not run any SQL. It runs after `dbt_migration-generate` and before the live `equivalency-validate` loop, so the cheap, high-frequency divergences are caught before anyone pays for a parallel run.

This is **Tier 1** of the three-tier equivalence approach in `wire/platform_pairs/dbt_neutral_translation.md`:

- **Tier 1 — this command.** Dialect parse-validation + silent-behaviour-change lint. Offline, seconds, no warehouse, no data.
- **Tier 2 — logical smoke test.** Same seed data through both logics in a local engine (DuckDB). Catches structural/grain breakage, *not* dialect semantics. Optional, separate.
- **Tier 3 — `equivalency-validate`.** The real parallel run on both warehouses with real data. The source of truth.

**What this command does not do:** it does not prove output equivalence. Every rule here flags a *risk* a naive translation would miss; clearing the lint means the model is free of known silent-divergence patterns, not that its output matches. Tier 3 remains mandatory. Say so in the report header so a green lint is never mistaken for a pass.

## Relationship to `dbt_migration-validate`

The two are complementary and must not be merged:

| | `dbt_migration-validate` | `dbt_migration-lint` (this) |
|---|---|---|
| Question | Does the translated model *compile* and is the translation *complete*? | Does the translated model *mean the same thing*? |
| Catches | Untranslated source-platform functions, missing files, Jinja errors, `dbt compile` failures | Valid target SQL that diverges silently — arg-order flips, NULL-handling, timezone, boundary semantics, hash mismatch |
| Needs target profile | Optionally (for `dbt compile`) | Never |
| Example miss if absent | `DATEADD(...)` left untranslated | `DATE_DIFF(start, end, DAY)` — compiles, wrong sign |

`validate` Check 2 ("no source-platform functions remain") is about completeness. This command assumes translation happened and asks whether it was *correct*.

## Flags

- `--batch N` — lint batch N only (default: `current_batch` in status.md)
- `--model name` — lint a single translated model
- `--severity error|warn|info` — minimum severity to report (default: `info`)
- `--format md|json` — report format (default: `md`; `json` for CI gating)

## Inputs

- Translated model SQL in `migration/dbt/` (output of `dbt_migration-generate`)
- Source model SQL at `migration.dbt_project_path` (for the before/after pair)
- Active platform pair, resolved from `status.md` `source_platform` / `target_platform`:
  - `wire/platform_pairs/{pair}/feature_detection.md` — the tag regexes the rules build on
  - `wire/platform_pairs/{pair}/translation_reference.md` — the §11 gotcha checklist this rule set is derived from; the authoritative description for every rule
  - `wire/platform_pairs/{pair}/translation_guide.md` — pattern table
- Engagement overrides at `.wire/engagement/platform_pair_overrides/{pair}/lint_rules.md`, if present — extra rules or per-engagement severity overrides, layered on top (override wins on the same rule id)
- `<migration.dbt_project_path>/target/manifest.json` — the resolved source `config.materialized` per model, for `MATERIALIZATION_DRIFT`; when absent, fall back to the `dbt_project.yml` + in-file config scan and note the reduced confidence per model
- The engagement's materialisation overrides file at `migration.materialization_overrides_path` (status.md), if set — declared overrides suppress `MATERIALIZATION_DRIFT` hits

## Engines

Two detection engines, in preference order. The command uses whichever is available and records which in the report.

1. **AST (preferred) — `sqlglot`.** Parse each translated model in the *target* dialect and each source model in the *source* dialect. This gives two things regex cannot:
   - **Parse-validation**: a model that fails to parse in its declared dialect is an immediate `error` (rule `PARSE`). This is the "is it even valid target SQL" gate, offline.
   - **Structural rules**: argument counts and order, function names, presence of clauses (`IGNORE NULLS`, `WHERE` before `QUALIFY`) read off the parse tree rather than guessed from text. Far fewer false positives than regex.
   sqlglot also transpiles, so where a rule has a deterministic fix the report can show sqlglot's suggested rewrite as a starting point (never auto-applied here — that's `dbt_migration-generate`'s job).
2. **Regex fallback.** When sqlglot is not installed, fall back to line-based regex from `feature_detection.md` plus the rule patterns below. Lower precision (multi-line constructs and context are missed — see the `feature_detection.md` note on line-based matching), so the report header must state "regex mode — reduced precision; install sqlglot for AST checks."

Jinja first: render or strip `{{ ... }}` / `{% ... %}` before parsing. A model that is mostly macros may be unparseable as raw SQL — lint the compiled SQL if a `target/compiled/` artifact exists, otherwise lint the static SQL spans between Jinja tags and note the coverage gap per model.

## Rule catalogue

Rules are derived from `translation_reference.md` §11 and the per-pair `feature_detection.md`. Each rule has: a stable `id`, a `severity`, the `detect` signal, and a `fix` hint. Severity reflects likelihood of a *silent* wrong answer, not how hard it is to fix.

`error` = compiles and is almost certainly wrong. `warn` = compiles and is wrong unless a specific precondition holds (check it). `info` = review-worthy, often fine.

### Snowflake → BigQuery rules

### BigQuery → Snowflake rules

| id | severity | detect (on translated Snowflake SQL) | fix hint | ref |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `PARSE` | error | Fails to parse as Snowflake SQL | Not valid Snowflake — re-translate | — |
| `ARRAY_CONTAINS_ARGORDER` | warn | `ARRAY_CONTAINS(` translated from `IN UNNEST` | Snowflake is `(value, array)` — reverse of BQ; value must be `::variant` | §13 |
| `STRUCT_LEFTOVER` | error | `STRUCT(` present (no Snowflake STRUCT literal) | Use `OBJECT_CONSTRUCT('k', v, ...)` | §6 |
| `SAFE_PREFIX_LEFTOVER` | error | `SAFE.` prefix or `SAFE_CAST` left untranslated | Snowflake uses `TRY_CAST`/`TRY_TO_*` | §1.5 |
| `OFFSET_ORDINAL` | warn | `[OFFSET(n)]`/`[ORDINAL(n)]` array access | Snowflake arrays are 0-based `a[n]`; ORDINAL is 1-based | §13 |
| `DOW_NUMBERING` | warn | `DAYOFWEEK` arithmetic | Snowflake honours `WEEK_START`; confirm the account default | §5.5 |
| `MEDIAN_WINDOW` | info | `PERCENTILE_CONT(... ) OVER ()` translated to Snowflake | Snowflake `MEDIAN`/`PERCENTILE_CONT ... WITHIN GROUP` is a true aggregate | §5.6 |

### Direction-agnostic rules

These run in both directions and in both engines — they read model config, not the SQL parse tree, so they work identically under AST and regex modes.

| id | severity | detect (on translated model config) | fix hint | ref |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MATERIALIZATION_DRIFT` | warn | Translated model's resolved materialisation (in-file `{{ config(...) }}` / companion YAML) differs from the source manifest node's `config.materialized`, and no rule in the engagement's materialisation overrides file declares the change | Restore the preserved source materialisation, or declare the change as an override rule so it is on the record | `generate.md` "Materialisation config" |

`MATERIALIZATION_DRIFT` exists precisely because `dbt-migration-generate`'s materialisation hook (preserve-by-default plus declarative overrides) cannot catch every case: a model hand-edited after generation, or a model where no override was declared and the written materialisation is simply wrong. The hook is proactive, this rule is the after-the-fact backstop — both are intentionally kept; they are complementary, not redundant. A hit is not automatically a defect: when the overrides file declares the change (the model matches a rule's `select`, is not caught by its `exclude`, and the written materialisation equals that rule's `force_materialized`), the rule stays silent — a declared override is the hook working as designed, never a lint finding. Severity is `warn` because an undeclared change compiles fine and silently re-shapes the build: an incremental flattened to `table` changes cost and freshness, and with late-arriving data can change results.

Engagement override files may add rows (e.g. a client-specific UDF that has no target equivalent) or downgrade a severity with a documented reason.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Resolve scope and pair
Read `current_batch` (or `--batch`/`--model`) and the batch model list. Resolve the platform pair from status.md. Load the pair's `feature_detection.md`, `translation_reference.md`, and any engagement `lint_rules.md` overrides. Detect whether `sqlglot` is importable; pick the engine and note it.

### Step 2 — Per-model lint
For each model in scope:
1. Strip/render Jinja; obtain the largest parseable SQL (compiled artifact if available).
2. **Parse-check** in the target dialect → `PARSE` rule on failure.
3. Run every rule for the active direction, plus the direction-agnostic rules. AST rules read the tree; regex rules apply the pattern; config rules (`MATERIALIZATION_DRIFT`) compare the translated model's config against the source manifest and the declared overrides. Each hit records: `model`, `rule_id`, `severity`, line/span, the offending snippet, the fix hint, and the `translation_reference.md` section.
4. Where a rule has a deterministic rewrite and sqlglot is present, attach the suggested fix (informational).

### Step 3 — Write the report
Write `migration/lint/batch_N_lint.md` (and `.json` if `--format json`). Structure:
- **Header**: engine used, direction, batch, model count, the "Tier 1 — not an equivalence pass; Tier 3 still required" disclaimer.
- **Summary**: counts by severity; models clean vs flagged.
- **Findings**: grouped by model, ordered by severity. Each finding shows snippet, fix hint, and reference link.
- **Coverage gaps**: models that could only be partially parsed (heavy Jinja, no compiled artifact), so a clean result there is "not fully checked", not "clean".

### Step 4 — Update status
```yaml
artifacts:
  dbt_migration:
    lint: pass | fail
    linted_date: "{{TODAY}}"
    batch_N_lint: pass | fail
    batch_N_lint_findings:
      error: <n>
      warn: <n>
      info: <n>
```
`fail` when any `error`-severity finding remains unresolved (warn/info do not fail the gate by default; `--severity` can tighten this for CI).

## CI gating

With `--format json --severity error`, the command exits non-zero when any `error` finding exists, so it drops into a pre-merge check on the migration repo. The intent is to stop a translated batch reaching the (paid) Tier 3 parallel run while it still carries a known silent-divergence pattern. Document any rule deliberately suppressed for a batch in the batch summary, the same way `-- MANUAL REVIEW` flags are tracked — silent suppression reads as "clean" when it isn't.

## Notes for the implementer

- The rule catalogue is the contract; `translation_reference.md` §11 is the prose behind it. When the reference gains a gotcha, add a rule here with the same section ref — keep them in lockstep.
- Prefer AST over regex for anything with arguments (`DATEDIFF_ARGORDER`, `LOG_ARGORDER`, `ARRAY_AGG_NULLS`). Regex versions are a fallback and should be conservative — a false `error` that blocks CI is worse than a missed `warn`.
- This command is read-only over the translated SQL. It never edits models. Fixes flow back through `dbt_migration-generate` (re-translate) or a hand edit, then re-lint.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
