# Design data pipeline architecture and data flow diagram

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command

# Pipeline Design Generate Command

Follow `specs/utils/data_designer_delegate.md` before executing the workflow below.

## Purpose

Generate a comprehensive data pipeline architecture document covering: source system analysis, replication strategy, data flow, error handling, scheduling, and monitoring approach. Also produces a **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** as a Mermaid flowchart showing the end-to-end movement of data from source systems through to the BI layer.

## Usage

```bash
/wire:pipeline_design-generate YYYYMMDD_project_name
```

## Prerequisites

- `requirements`: `review: approved`
- `conceptual_model`: `review: approved` — the pipeline design uses approved entities as reference

## Workflow

### Step 1: Verify Prerequisites and Read Inputs

1. Read `.wire/<project_id>/status.md`
2. Verify `requirements.review == approved`. If not:
   ```
   Error: Requirements must be approved before pipeline design.
   Run: /wire:requirements-review <project_id>
   ```
3. Verify `conceptual_model.review == approved`. If not:
   ```
   Error: Conceptual model must be approved before pipeline design.
   The pipeline design maps source systems to the agreed business entities.
   Run: /wire:conceptual_model-review <project_id>
   ```
4. Read `.wire/<project_id>/requirements/requirements_specification.md`
5. Read `.wire/<project_id>/design/conceptual_model.md`
6. Use Glob to find all files in `.wire/<project_id>/artifacts/**/*`
7. Read any source schema examples, SQL files, API documentation, or existing pipeline code in `artifacts/`

### Step 2: Analyse Source Systems

For each source system identified in requirements:
- **Technology**: Database type (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, API, flat files, etc.)
- **Schema**: Tables/endpoints relevant to the in-scope entities from the conceptual model
- **Volume**: Row counts, growth rate, transaction frequency
- **Availability**: Uptime, maintenance windows, access method
- **Sensitivity**: PII fields, data governance constraints

Cross-reference source tables/endpoints against the approved conceptual model entities. Flag any entities in the conceptual model that have no clear source system mapping — these are data gaps.

### Step 3: Choose Pipeline Replication Tool

Before defining the per-source replication strategy, the team must align on which tool will manage data replication. Present this as **Design Decision PD-1** (or the next available PD-N if earlier decisions exist):

```
**PD-1: Pipeline Replication Tool**
Context: The choice of replication tool affects connector coverage, cost model,
infrastructure footprint, and ongoing maintenance burden.

Options:

| Option | Best for | Cost model | Connectors | Infrastructure |
|--------|----------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **Fivetran** | SaaS sources, minimal engineering, managed CDC | MAR-based (Monthly Active Rows) | 500+ pre-built | Fully managed, no infra |
| **dlt (data load tool)** | Python-native teams, custom APIs, cost-sensitive | Open-source / dlt Cloud | Community + custom | Python scripts, self-hosted or dlt Cloud |
| **Airbyte** | Mixed SaaS + custom sources, open-source preference | Open-source / Airbyte Cloud | 350+ connectors | Self-hosted (Docker/K8s) or Airbyte Cloud |
| **Custom / bespoke** | Highly specialised sources, full control required | Engineering time | N/A | Self-managed |

Recommendation: [Select based on source systems identified in Step 2 — SaaS-heavy projects
favour Fivetran; Python-heavy or cost-sensitive projects favour dlt]
Input required from: Data Team Lead / CTO
```

If the client has already expressed a tool preference (in requirements or workshops), note it here and skip the decision — but still confirm it is appropriate for all source systems.

**After tool selection: verify connector/source support**

Once the tool is chosen, verify that it can handle each source system identified in Step 2:

- **Fivetran**: Call `mcp__fivetran__list_metadata_connectors` and verify each source system has a matching connector. For any source where a connector is found, call `mcp__fivetran__get_metadata_connector_config` to confirm the required config fields (API keys, OAuth scopes, host/database params) — document these in the design so the implementation step is not blocked by missing credentials.
- **dlt**: Check `dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources` for verified sources; note which require custom REST source implementation.
- **Airbyte**: Check `docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources` for connector availability and support tier (Generally Available / Beta / Alpha).
- **Custom**: Document the ingestion approach (Cloud Function, Cloud Run job, direct JDBC) per source.

Record the chosen tool in **Section 6 (Technology Stack)** and as `pipeline_tool` in status.md (Step 8).

### Step 4: Define Replication Strategy

For each source system, assess and recommend a replication approach using the chosen tool:

**Replication options** (select based on source capabilities and freshness requirements):
- **Full refresh**: Simple, high-cost at scale, suitable for small/slowly-changing tables
- **Incremental by timestamp**: Efficient, requires a reliable `updated_at` column
- **CDC (Change Data Capture)**: Real-time or near-real-time — supported by Fivetran (log-based), Airbyte (Debezium-based), or custom Debezium setup
- **API polling**: For SaaS sources without database access — all three tools support this
- **Batch extract**: Scheduled SQL exports or file drops — typically custom or dlt

For **Fivetran-based** sources, also include:
- Confirmed connector service slug (from `get_metadata_connector_config`)
- MAR (Monthly Active Rows) estimate and cost implication
- Whether server-side SQL views can reduce MAR by filtering rows at source

For **dlt-based** sources, also include:
- Whether a verified source exists or custom implementation is needed
- Incremental loading strategy (`append`, `merge`, or `replace`)

For **Airbyte-based** sources, also include:
- Connector support tier (GA / Beta / Alpha) and any known limitations
- Sync mode per stream (full refresh / incremental append / incremental deduped)

Present options as numbered scenarios (Scenario A, B, C) where trade-offs exist — do not silently choose. Flag decisions requiring client input as **Design Decision PD-N**.

### Step 5: Define Pipeline Architecture

Specify the end-to-end pipeline:

**Landing / Raw layer**:
- Where replicated data lands (dataset names, schema)
- Naming convention: `fivetran_<source>`, `raw_<source>`, etc.

**Staging layer**:
- dbt staging models that will be built from raw data
- Mapping: raw table → `stg_<source>__<entity>` model name
- Reference the approved conceptual model entities

**Warehouse layer**:
- Fact tables, dimension tables, aggregates
- Reference the data model specification (generated separately)

**Error handling**:
- How pipeline failures are detected and surfaced
- Retry logic
- Alerting approach (Slack, email, monitoring dashboard)

**Scheduling**:
- Refresh cadence per source (real-time, hourly, daily, etc.)
- dbt Cloud job schedules
- Dependencies between pipeline runs and dbt jobs

### Step 6: Document Design Decisions

For each decision requiring client input, create a numbered entry:

```
**PD-1: [Decision Title]**
Context: [Why this decision is needed]
Options:
  - Option A: [Description] — [pros/cons, cost implication]
  - Option B: [Description] — [pros/cons, cost implication]
Recommendation: [Preferred option and rationale]
Input required from: [Who needs to decide — DBA, Data Team Lead, CTO, etc.]
```

### Step 7: Generate Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

Produce a Mermaid `graph LR` flowchart showing the complete data flow from source systems to BI dashboards. Write this as a `## Data Flow Diagram` section within the pipeline architecture document.

Use this structure:

```
## Data Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph src["Source Systems"]
        SRC1["<System Name>\n<Technology>"]
        SRC2["<System Name>\n<Technology>"]
    end

    subgraph ingest["Data Ingestion\n(<Tool e.g. Fivetran CDC>)"]
        ING1["<connector_name>\n<tables/endpoints>"]
        ING2["<connector_name>\n<tables/endpoints>"]
    end

    subgraph staging["Staging Layer\n(BigQuery views — dbt)"]
        STG1["stg_<source>__<entity>"]
        STG2["stg_<source>__<entity>"]
    end

    subgraph warehouse["Warehouse Layer\n(BigQuery tables — dbt)"]
        FCT1["<entity>_fct"]
        DIM1["<entity>_dim"]
        AGG1["<aggregate_model>"]
    end

    subgraph bi["BI Layer\n(Looker)"]
        EX["<explore_name> Explore"]
        DB["<Dashboard Name>"]
    end

    SRC1 --> ING1
    SRC2 --> ING2
    ING1 --> STG1
    ING2 --> STG2
    STG1 --> FCT1
    STG2 --> FCT1
    FCT1 --> AGG1
    AGG1 --> EX
    EX --> DB
```
```

Replace all `<placeholders>` with project-specific values from the requirements and conceptual model. Staging model names must match the naming convention (`stg_<source>__<entity>`). Warehouse model names must match the agreed naming convention (`<entity>_fct`, `<entity>_dim`).

### Step 8: Write Pipeline Architecture Document

Write to `.wire/<project_id>/design/pipeline_architecture.md`:

```markdown
# Pipeline Architecture: [Project Name]

**Client**: [Client Name]
**Project ID**: [Project ID]
**Generated**: [Date]
**Version**: 1.0

## 1. Source Systems

[Table: System | Technology | In-scope tables/endpoints | Replication method | Refresh cadence]

## 2. Replication Strategy

[Scenarios A/B/C with cost and trade-off analysis]

## 3. Pipeline Architecture

### 3.1 Landing / Raw Layer
[Dataset names, naming convention]

### 3.2 Staging Layer
[dbt staging models — mapping from raw → stg_]

### 3.3 Warehouse Layer
[Fact/dim tables — high level, detail in data_model spec]

### 3.4 Error Handling
[Failure detection, retry, alerting]

### 3.5 Scheduling
[Refresh cadences, dbt job config, dependencies]

## 4. Data Flow Diagram

[Mermaid DFD as generated in Step 6]

## 5. Design Decisions

[PD-1 through PD-N as generated in Step 5]

## 6. Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Version/Tier |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Replication | [Fivetran/Airbyte/custom] | [connector type] |
| Transformation | dbt Cloud | [dbt version] |
| Warehouse | BigQuery | [dataset location] |
| BI | Looker | [instance URL] |
| Orchestration | [dbt Cloud / Airflow / Cloud Scheduler] | |

## 7. Security and Data Governance

[PII handling, column exclusions, access controls, data residency]
```

### Step 9: Update Status

```yaml
pipeline_design:
  generate: complete
  validate: not_started
  review: not_started
  file: design/pipeline_architecture.md
  generated_date: [today]
pipeline:
  pipeline_tool: [fivetran | dlt | airbyte | custom]  # chosen in Step 3
```

Write `pipeline_tool` under `artifacts.pipeline` in status.md now, even though the pipeline artifact itself has not been generated yet. This records the design decision so downstream commands can route correctly without re-reading the design document.

### Step 10: Sync to Jira (Optional)

Follow the Jira sync workflow in `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`:
- Artifact: `pipeline_design`
- Action: `generate`
- Status: the generate state just written to status.md

### Step 11: Sync to Document Store (Optional)

If a document store is configured for this project, follow the workflow in `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`:
- `artifact_id`: `pipeline_design`
- `artifact_name`: `Pipeline Design`
- `file_path`: `.wire/releases/[release_folder]/design/pipeline_design.md`
- `project_id`: the release folder path (e.g. `releases/01-discovery`)

If docstore sync fails, log the error and continue — do not block the generate command.

### Step 12: Confirm and Suggest Next Steps

```
## Pipeline Design Generated

**File**: .wire/<project_id>/design/pipeline_architecture.md

**Pipeline tool**: [fivetran | dlt | airbyte | custom]
**Source systems**: [count]
**Connectors verified**: [count — connectors confirmed to exist in the chosen tool]
**Design decisions requiring input**: [count — flag if > 0, include PD-1 tool choice if unresolved]
**Data flow diagram**: included

### Next Steps

1. Validate the pipeline design:
   /wire:pipeline_design-validate <project_id>

2. After validation, technical review:
   /wire:pipeline_design-review <project_id>

3. Once design is approved, create pipeline connections:
   /wire:pipeline-generate <project_id>

NOTE: If there are open design decisions (PD-N items) — especially PD-1 (tool choice) —
resolve these before or during the review session. The tool choice gates all
downstream pipeline commands.
```

## Edge Cases

### Multiple Viable Replication Scenarios

Always present options — never silently choose. The cost implication (MAR, compute, engineering time) belongs to the client, not the consultant.

### Source Schema Not Available in Artifacts

If source schema examples are absent:
1. Generate the architecture at the entity level (from the conceptual model)
2. Add a note: "Detailed table mapping requires source schema — add SQL schema dumps or query examples to artifacts/ before finalising"
3. List what schema information is needed and who should provide it

### Existing Pipeline in Place

If the client already has a pipeline (e.g. Fivetran partially configured):
1. Document the existing setup in Section 1
2. Design only the incremental additions (new connectors, new tables)
3. Note what must not be changed to avoid breaking existing flows

## Output

This command creates:
- `.wire/<project_id>/design/pipeline_architecture.md` (includes DFD)
- Updates `.wire/<project_id>/status.md`

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
