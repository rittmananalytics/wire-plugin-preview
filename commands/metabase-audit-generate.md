# Catalog Metabase collections, dashboards, cards/SQL, and permission groups

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command
- `specs/<path>.md` references are shared workflow docs shipped with this plugin — read them from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/specs/<path>.md`. If the path matches a Wire command (e.g. `specs/requirements/generate.md`), it means that command (`/wire:requirements-generate`) and its spec is already embedded in the command file.

## Tracing (opt-in, off by default)

description: Internal utility — opt-in step-level execution tracing to .wire/releases/<release>/trace.jsonl when WIRE_TRACE=true
---

# Tracing — Detailed, Opt-In, Step-Level Execution Trace

## Purpose

`execution_log.md` records one terse row per whole command (timestamp, command, result, a detail string capped at 120 characters). That's enough for a normal audit trail, but it can't answer "what actually happened inside that command, step by step" — which specific files it read, what it inferred, what it proposed, what a consultant decided, why. Tracing exists for engagements that want that depth: a complete, structured, append-only record of every step of every command, scoped to the release and release type it ran under.

**Off by default.** Tracing never runs unless `WIRE_TRACE=true` is set in the shell environment. If it isn't, skip this entire section — do nothing, check nothing further, proceed straight to the Workflow Specification exactly as if this section didn't exist. This is the common case and must add zero overhead.

## Where it writes

`.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl` — one JSON object per line (JSON Lines), append-only, alongside that release's `status.md` and `execution_log.md`.

For commands not scoped to a specific release (cross-cutting utilities with `release_types: []` in their own front-matter, or any command whose argument isn't a release folder), write to `.wire/trace.jsonl` at the engagement level instead, with `release` and `release_type` fields set to `null`.

This file is **local only** — nothing in it is ever sent anywhere, unlike the anonymous Segment telemetry event described elsewhere. It stays on the consultant's machine, inside the engagement's own repo, exactly like `execution_log.md`.

## What to log, and when

If `WIRE_TRACE=true`:

1. **Resolve context once, before anything else**: the release folder (from this command's own argument, if it has one) and `release_type` (read `.wire/releases/<release_folder>/status.md`'s `project_type` or `release_type` field). If this command has no release-folder argument, both are `null`.
2. **Emit a `command_start` event** before beginning the Workflow Specification below.
3. **As you work through the Workflow Specification's own numbered steps, emit a `step` event after completing each one** — and where a step itself has meaningfully distinct numbered sub-parts (e.g. "check location A, then location B, then infer a match, then propose it"), treat each of those as its own step event too rather than collapsing them into one. The `detail` field has no length limit and is not a summary — write what actually happened: values found, files read, decisions made and why, what was proposed and what the consultant chose. If this step involved the data model registry or any other external/optional resource, log it explicitly: whether it was reached, what was searched, what matched (or didn't, and why not), and whether/how the result was used downstream.
4. **Emit a `command_end` event** when the workflow finishes, with the same `result` value this command would write to `execution_log.md` (`complete`, `pass`, `fail`, `approved`, etc.).

## How to emit an event

Use this pattern for every event (adjust the heredoc body and the Python literals per call — this is a template, not a fixed script):

```bash
[ "${WIRE_TRACE:-false}" = "true" ] && {
  mkdir -p ".wire/releases/<release_folder>" 2>/dev/null
  cat > "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt" << 'WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF'
<the full, untruncated detail text for this event — safe to include quotes,
newlines, code snippets, anything; this heredoc is not shell-interpreted>
WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF
  python3 -c "
import json, datetime
detail = open('/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt').read().rstrip('\n')
event = {
    'ts': datetime.datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'),
    'release': '<release_folder_or_null>',
    'release_type': '<release_type_or_null>',
    'command': 'metabase-audit-generate',
    'event': '<command_start|step|command_end>',
    'step': '<step_number_or_null>',
    'step_name': '<step_heading_or_null>',
    'result': '<result_value_or_null>',
    'detail': detail,
}
with open('.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl', 'a') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(event) + chr(10))
"
  rm -f "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt"
}
```

- `<release_folder_or_null>` / `<release_type_or_null>`: from Step 1 above; write the literal JSON `null` (no quotes) if either doesn't apply, or a quoted string if it does.
- `event`: `command_start`, `step`, or `command_end`.
- `step` / `step_name`: `null` for `command_start`/`command_end`; the step's own number (e.g. `"1.5"`) and heading (e.g. `"Check for a Canonical Vertical Match"`) for a `step` event.
- `result`: `null` except on `command_end`.
- Adjust the file path in the final `open(...)` call to `.wire/trace.jsonl` for engagement-level (non-release-scoped) commands.

## Rules

1. **Never block or fail the workflow.** If a trace write fails for any reason (disk full, permissions), continue the workflow regardless — trace failures are never surfaced to the user and never stop anything.
2. **Append only** — never rewrite or delete existing lines in `trace.jsonl`.
3. **This is additive to `execution_log.md` and Telemetry, not a replacement for either.** All three continue exactly as documented elsewhere; tracing is a separate, optional, much finer-grained record for engagements that opt in.
4. **Don't summarize into brevity.** The entire point of this mechanism over `execution_log.md` is that it isn't limited to a 120-character line — write the real detail.

## Automatic Validation (on by default)

---
description: Internal utility — injected auto-validate section so generate commands run their matching validate step automatically and fold the result into their output
---

Every `generate` command that has a matching `validate` command for the
same artifact runs that validate step automatically as part of generate —
by default, with no separate command to remember. This section only appears
on commands where that applies; artifacts with no separate validate step at
all (e.g. mockups, workshops, UAT) never carry this section.

## Step: Check `auto_validate`

Read this command's own `auto_validate` front-matter field, in the Workflow
Specification below. Two states:

- **Absent, or `true`** (the default — most artifacts): auto-validate runs.
- **`false`**: this artifact's validate step is expensive — it runs real
  code, queries a live warehouse or BI tool, or otherwise does IO beyond
  re-reading local files — so it does not run automatically. Skip to
  "If `auto_validate: false`" below.

## If `auto_validate` is absent or `true`: run validate automatically

Once this command finishes writing its artifact, before ending:

1. Run this artifact's own `/wire:<artifact-with-dashes>-validate` workflow
   in full, exactly as if the consultant had typed it themselves — same
   inputs, same `status.md` write to `artifacts.<artifact>.validate`, same
   report. This is not optional or an extra step layered on top; it is the
   default behavior for this artifact.
2. Fold the result into this command's own closing output rather than
   presenting it as a separate command run:
   - **PASS** — add a single closing line: `✅ Auto-validated — PASS`. The
     full report already went to `status.md`/`execution_log.md`, exactly as
     it would from a standalone validate run — no need to repeat it here.
   - **FAIL** — surface the validate command's own failure report in full,
     exactly as running validate standalone would show it, so the
     consultant sees what's wrong immediately without running anything
     else themselves.
3. This never blocks or undoes generate itself — the artifact is written
   either way, and its content is never rolled back because validate
   failed. Auto-validation only means validate has already run and its
   result is already on record by the time generate finishes, instead of
   waiting for the consultant to remember to run it separately.

## If `auto_validate` is `false`: state this plainly, don't run it

Do not run validate. End with a line naming why, as specifically as this
spec's own context makes possible (e.g. "runs `dbt run`/`dbt test`",
"queries the live target warehouse", "calls the Looker API directly") —
fall back to "performs live checks against an external system" only if no
more specific reason is evident from context:

```
⚠ This artifact's validate step [reason] and does not run automatically.
Run /wire:<artifact-with-dashes>-validate <release_folder> before
requesting review — review is blocked until it passes.
```

## Why this is always safe either way

`review` already requires `validate: PASS` for this same artifact as one of
its own declared preconditions (see `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md`) —
this is existing, independent enforcement, not something added by this
section. So an `auto_validate: false` opt-out never lets an artifact reach
review unvalidated; it only decides *when* the consultant pays validate's
cost — automatically on every draft (the default), or once, on their own
schedule, before requesting review (the opt-out). Auto-validation is a
convenience that closes the "forgot to run it" gap for the common case; the
gate that actually prevents unvalidated work from being reviewed was already
there.

# Metabase Audit — Generate

## Purpose

Catalogs the client's Metabase reporting layer: every collection, dashboard, and card/question (with its SQL), the warehouse objects each card reads from, and the permission groups that govern access. The output maps card-to-warehouse dependencies so the migration inventory can sequence cutover correctly — cards cannot be repointed to the target until their source warehouse objects exist there — and records which cards carry source-platform SQL dialect that needs translating.

This is the first member of the **BI-tool audit category** (#184) — audits of report/dashboard estates, a different object class from the semantic-model audits (Looker/Omni/OAC), which catalogue a modelling layer rather than an inventory of end-user reports. It is **not gated by `migration.scope`** — it runs for any migration where the client uses Metabase, full migration or tenant carve-out alike. Under a carve-out its catalog is what region tagging classifies (`item_type: metabase_card` / `metabase_dashboard`), so the tenant's reports get carve-in/exclude rulings like every other object.

Its output feeds four downstream consumers: `migration-inventory-generate` (card nodes and card-to-warehouse-model edges), `region-tagging-generate` (carve-out classification), `metabase-migration-generate` (dialect translation), and `metabase-carveout-generate` (tenant scoping) — which is why the catalog must carry the full per-card object graph (template tags, snippets, card references, the dashboards reverse index), not just the SQL.

## Prerequisites

- Release folder with `release_type: platform_migration` in `status.md`
- `migration.reporting_tool: metabase` set in `status.md`
- One of the following data sources (in priority order, see `skills/metabase/SKILL.md` Step 0):
  1. The **Metabase MCP server** (https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/ai/mcp), where the instance exposes it — the preferred discovery surface for enumeration and per-card reads
  2. metabase-cli / serialization export configured against the instance
  3. `MB_HOST` + `MB_API_KEY` (read-only) for the Metabase REST API
  4. Client-supplied query inventory CSV at `audit/metabase_cards_input.csv`

The MCP server serves **discovery and reads**; the write paths downstream (translation, carve, import) route through serialization or the REST API regardless, because bulk transformations need a diffable, reviewable artifact between read and write. All four sources produce the same catalog shape.

## Inputs

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/status.md`
- The Metabase instance (CLI export / REST API) or CSV fallback
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/dbt_audit.md` (if present — cross-reference dbt model dependencies)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Locate the release

Confirm `release_type: platform_migration` in `status.md`. Read `migration.reporting_tool` — if it is not `metabase`, stop and output:

```
reporting_tool is not set to metabase.
Set migration.reporting_tool: metabase in status.md and re-run.
```

Activate the `metabase` skill (`skills/metabase/SKILL.md`) for connection details and the object hierarchy.

If the audit file already exists at `audit/metabase_audit.md`, ask whether to re-generate (overwrite) or update (append new items only).

### Step 2: Connect to Metabase

Check data sources in priority order per `skills/metabase/SKILL.md` Step 0:

- **Option 0 — MCP server**: when the instance exposes the Metabase MCP server, use it to enumerate collections, dashboards, cards, databases, and permission groups, and for per-card reads. Set `data_source: mcp`.
- **Option 1 — serialization export**: export via the `mb` CLI and parse the YAML. Set `data_source: serialization`.
- **Option 2 — REST API**: enumerate collections, dashboards, cards, databases, and permission groups via the endpoints in the skill. Set `data_source: api`.
- **Option 3 — CSV fallback**: use `audit/metabase_cards_input.csv`. Set `data_source: csv`.

Whichever source is used, the catalog shape (Step 3) is identical — a downstream consumer never needs to know how the audit connected.

If none is available, stop and output the required CSV columns:

```
No Metabase data source found. Provide one of:

  1. metabase-cli configured against the instance (npx skills add metabase/agent-skills)
  2. MB_HOST + MB_API_KEY (read-only) for the REST API
  3. audit/metabase_cards_input.csv — exported card inventory

Required CSV columns:
  card_id, card_name, collection_id, collection_name, dashboard_ids,
  query_type, sql_summary, source_database_id, warehouse_objects,
  permission_groups, last_viewed_at, archived, include_in_migration, migration_notes

Then re-run: /wire:metabase-audit-generate $ARGUMENTS
```

### Step 3: Build the content catalog

Capture the collection → dashboard → card hierarchy, plus database connections and permission groups. For each card/question:

| Field | Source |
|---|---|
| `card_id` / `card_name` | card id / name |
| `collection_id` / `collection_name` | the card's collection |
| `dashboard_ids` | dashboards whose dashcards reference this card |
| `query_type` | `native` (SQL) or `mbql` |
| `sql_summary` | first 200 chars of `dataset_query.native.query` (full SQL from serialization/CSV) |
| `source_database_id` | the Metabase database connection the card runs against |
| `warehouse_objects` | resolved source tables/views (see resolution below) |
| `source_resolved` | true if ≥1 object resolved, else false |
| `permission_groups` | groups with access to the card's collection / database |
| `template_tags` | the card's `template-tags` — each tag's name, type, and (for field filters) the source-database **field id** it binds to. Field ids do not survive a connection change, so this is the remap input for `metabase-migration` |
| `snippets_used` | `{{snippet: name}}` references — snippets are separate objects with their own SQL and must be converted before the cards that use them |
| `card_references` | `{{#id-name}}` references to other cards — these create a conversion dependency order (leaf cards first) |
| `complexity` | assigned in Step 4 |
| `migration_approach` | assigned in Step 4 |
| `include_in_migration` | true (default) unless archived / unused >90 days |
| `migration_notes` | auto-generated |

Also catalog:
- **Database connections** — id, name, engine (e.g. `snowflake`), and which cards run against each. The connection is the pivot for repointing.
- **Permission groups and sandboxing** — each group, the databases/collections it can access (from the permission graph), and any **data sandboxing policies** (row-level filters per group) — under a carve-out, sandboxing is one of the candidate tenant-scoping layers, so it must be visible at audit time.
- **Snippets** — every snippet, its SQL, and the cards that use it.
- **The card-to-dashboards reverse index** — for every card, every dashboard whose dashcards reference it, with a `shared_card` flag when that count exceeds one. **Cards are shared objects**: editing a card on one dashboard changes it on all of them, so no downstream command may write to a card without this index in hand (the edit-in-place vs clone decision reads it). Also record each dashboard's own **filter parameter mappings** (dashboard parameters bound to card fields by field id — they need the same remap as template tags).

**Warehouse object extraction**: resolve `warehouse_objects` for every card.
- **`native` (SQL)** — parse the SQL to extract referenced schema-qualified table/view names.
- **`mbql`** — resolve to the table the MBQL question targets (dialect-neutral; no SQL to translate).
- Cross-reference resolved objects against the dbt audit where present, to confirm each is in migration scope.

For any card where no source object resolves, set `warehouse_objects` empty **and** `source_resolved: false` so it is counted and listed, never silently dropped.

**Source-resolution coverage metric**: over active (non-archived) cards, compute `active_card_count`, `resolved_card_count`, `unresolved_card_count`, and `source_resolution_coverage_pct = resolved / active`.

### Step 4: Classify each card

Assign complexity (Low / Medium / High) and migration approach:

- `repoint` — SQL is portable (or the card is MBQL); only the database connection changes after warehouse migration
- `rewrite_sql` — native SQL uses source-platform dialect; translate to the target dialect before repointing
- `rebuild` — the card depends on a source-only construct that has no direct translation; rebuild against the target connection
- `decommission` — archived or unused; exclude from migration

Default: active MBQL cards and simple portable-SQL cards → `repoint` (Low). Re-scan native SQL for source-dialect constructs (`::` casts, `FLATTEN`, `QUALIFY`, `IFF`, `NVL`, `CONVERT_TIMEZONE`, variant `:` paths) and reclassify `repoint` → `rewrite_sql` where found.

### Step 5: Write the audit report

**Output location**: `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/metabase_audit.md`

Include:
- Summary table (total cards, dashboards, collections; by approach; by complexity; **MBQL vs native split** — MBQL cards are dialect-neutral and usually the majority, so the split is what scopes the manual translation effort)
- **Source-resolution coverage**: `resolved_card_count` / `active_card_count` (`source_resolution_coverage_pct`), broken down by query type
- Full card catalog table
- Collection → dashboard → card hierarchy
- **Card-to-dashboards reverse index** — shared cards (on more than one dashboard) listed explicitly with their dashboard sets
- **Snippet inventory** and the **card-reference dependency edges** (which cards must convert before which)
- Database connection inventory (engine, cards per connection)
- **Permission group inventory** — each group, its database/collection access, and any sandboxing policies
- Warehouse object dependency map (which warehouse objects each card depends on)
- **Unresolved cards** — every active card with `source_resolved: false`, listed explicitly
- dbt model dependencies (cards that cannot be repointed until a dbt migration batch is complete)
- Excluded / decommission candidates

### Step 6: Update status

```yaml
artifacts:
  metabase_audit:
    generate: complete
    file: audit/metabase_audit.md
    generated_date: "{{TODAY}}"
    tool: metabase
    card_count: N
    dashboard_count: N
    collection_count: N
    permission_group_count: N
    data_source: "mcp" | "serialization" | "api" | "csv"
    native_card_count: N
    mbql_card_count: N
    shared_card_count: N          # cards on more than one dashboard (the reverse index)
    snippet_count: N
    decommission_count: N
    active_card_count: N
    resolved_card_count: N
    unresolved_card_count: N
    source_resolution_coverage_pct: 0.00
```

### Step 7: Output summary

Print: totals, breakdown by approach/complexity, source-resolution coverage (with unresolved count called out), and next command:

```
/wire:metabase-audit-validate $ARGUMENTS
```

## Output Files

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/metabase_audit.md`
- Updated `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/status.md`


## Post-Execution Hooks

After updating `status.md`, run these in sequence:

1. **Execution log** — Append one row to `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/execution_log.md` following `specs/utils/execution_log.md`.

2. **Jira sync** — Follow `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `metabase_audit` as artifact, `generate` as action.

3. **Document store** — Follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `metabase_audit` as artifact_id, `Metabase Audit` as artifact_name, and the `file` value from `artifacts.metabase_audit` in status.md as file_path.

4. **Auto-commit** — Follow `specs/utils/commit.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as release_folder, `metabase_audit` as artifact, `generate` as action.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

---
description: Internal utility — appends a log entry to the project's execution log after any generate/validate/review workflow or skill activation
---

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Stale Status Check

Immediately after appending a **command** row (this does not apply to skill activation entries), perform a quick freshness check against the project's `status.md`. This is additive to the logging behavior above — it never blocks the calling command and never modifies `status.md`.

**Process**:
1. Derive `artifact_id` from the command just logged: strip the `/wire:` prefix and the trailing `-generate`, `-validate`, or `-review` suffix (e.g. `/wire:migration-inventory-generate` → `migration_inventory`). If the command doesn't map to a recognizable artifact (e.g. `/wire:new`, `/wire:status`, `/wire:archive`), skip this check entirely.
2. Read the artifact's own block in `status.md`: `artifacts.<artifact_id>`.
3. Check whether that artifact has already passed its review/approval gate — its `review` field (or equivalent approval field) shows `pass`, `approved`, or `complete`.
4. If the gate has passed, scan every field in the `artifacts.<artifact_id>` block for a value that is still the literal string `TBD`, or an empty list (`[]`) / `null` where the artifact's own template expects a populated value (i.e. the field is not legitimately optional).
5. For each stale field found, emit a one-line warning in the command's output:
   ```
   ⚠ status.md still shows `<field>: TBD` for `<artifact_id>` despite review: pass — status may be stale
   ```
   Emit one warning per stale field — do not suppress after the first.
6. After the last warning (only when at least one was emitted), add one closing line offering the repair path:
   ```
   Run /wire:status-sync <release-folder> to reconcile the record (see specs/utils/status_sync.md).
   ```
   The offer is informational only — never block the calling command and never run the sync automatically.
7. If no stale fields are found, the review/approval gate has not yet passed, or `artifact_id` could not be derived: no output, proceed silently.

This check is self-contained within this utility, so every caller gets it automatically without any caller-side changes.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
