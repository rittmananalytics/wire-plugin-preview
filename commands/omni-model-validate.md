# Validate a model batch on the branch: Omni validator clean, every in-scope field present, one smoke query per topic

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command
- `specs/<path>.md` references are shared workflow docs shipped with this plugin — read them from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/specs/<path>.md`. If the path matches a Wire command (e.g. `specs/requirements/generate.md`), it means that command (`/wire:requirements-generate`) and its spec is already embedded in the command file.

## Tracing (opt-in, off by default)

---
description: Internal utility — opt-in step-level execution tracing to .wire/releases/<release>/trace.jsonl when WIRE_TRACE=true
---

# Tracing — Detailed, Opt-In, Step-Level Execution Trace

## Purpose

`execution_log.md` records one terse row per whole command (timestamp, command, result, a detail string capped at 120 characters). That's enough for a normal audit trail, but it can't answer "what actually happened inside that command, step by step" — which specific files it read, what it inferred, what it proposed, what a consultant decided, why. Tracing exists for engagements that want that depth: a complete, structured, append-only record of every step of every command, scoped to the release and release type it ran under.

**Off by default.** Tracing never runs unless `WIRE_TRACE=true` is set in the shell environment. If it isn't, skip this entire section — do nothing, check nothing further, proceed straight to the Workflow Specification exactly as if this section didn't exist. This is the common case and must add zero overhead.

## Where it writes

`.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl` — one JSON object per line (JSON Lines), append-only, alongside that release's `status.md` and `execution_log.md`.

For commands not scoped to a specific release (cross-cutting utilities with `release_types: []` in their own front-matter, or any command whose argument isn't a release folder), write to `.wire/trace.jsonl` at the engagement level instead, with `release` and `release_type` fields set to `null`.

This file is **local only** — nothing in it is ever sent anywhere, unlike the anonymous Segment telemetry event described elsewhere. It stays on the consultant's machine, inside the engagement's own repo, exactly like `execution_log.md`.

## What to log, and when

If `WIRE_TRACE=true`:

1. **Resolve context once, before anything else**: the release folder (from this command's own argument, if it has one) and `release_type` (read `.wire/releases/<release_folder>/status.md`'s `project_type` or `release_type` field). If this command has no release-folder argument, both are `null`.
2. **Emit a `command_start` event** before beginning the Workflow Specification below.
3. **As you work through the Workflow Specification's own numbered steps, emit a `step` event after completing each one** — and where a step itself has meaningfully distinct numbered sub-parts (e.g. "check location A, then location B, then infer a match, then propose it"), treat each of those as its own step event too rather than collapsing them into one. The `detail` field has no length limit and is not a summary — write what actually happened: values found, files read, decisions made and why, what was proposed and what the consultant chose. If this step involved the data model registry or any other external/optional resource, log it explicitly: whether it was reached, what was searched, what matched (or didn't, and why not), and whether/how the result was used downstream.
4. **Emit a `command_end` event** when the workflow finishes, with the same `result` value this command would write to `execution_log.md` (`complete`, `pass`, `fail`, `approved`, etc.).

## How to emit an event

Use this pattern for every event (adjust the heredoc body and the Python literals per call — this is a template, not a fixed script):

```bash
[ "${WIRE_TRACE:-false}" = "true" ] && {
  mkdir -p ".wire/releases/<release_folder>" 2>/dev/null
  cat > "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt" << 'WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF'
<the full, untruncated detail text for this event — safe to include quotes,
newlines, code snippets, anything; this heredoc is not shell-interpreted>
WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF
  python3 -c "
import json, datetime
detail = open('/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt').read().rstrip('\n')
event = {
    'ts': datetime.datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'),
    'release': '<release_folder_or_null>',
    'release_type': '<release_type_or_null>',
    'command': 'omni-model-validate',
    'event': '<command_start|step|command_end>',
    'step': '<step_number_or_null>',
    'step_name': '<step_heading_or_null>',
    'result': '<result_value_or_null>',
    'detail': detail,
}
with open('.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl', 'a') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(event) + chr(10))
"
  rm -f "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt"
}
```

- `<release_folder_or_null>` / `<release_type_or_null>`: from Step 1 above; write the literal JSON `null` (no quotes) if either doesn't apply, or a quoted string if it does.
- `event`: `command_start`, `step`, or `command_end`.
- `step` / `step_name`: `null` for `command_start`/`command_end`; the step's own number (e.g. `"1.5"`) and heading (e.g. `"Check for a Canonical Vertical Match"`) for a `step` event.
- `result`: `null` except on `command_end`.
- Adjust the file path in the final `open(...)` call to `.wire/trace.jsonl` for engagement-level (non-release-scoped) commands.

## Rules

1. **Never block or fail the workflow.** If a trace write fails for any reason (disk full, permissions), continue the workflow regardless — trace failures are never surfaced to the user and never stop anything.
2. **Append only** — never rewrite or delete existing lines in `trace.jsonl`.
3. **This is additive to `execution_log.md` and Telemetry, not a replacement for either.** All three continue exactly as documented elsewhere; tracing is a separate, optional, much finer-grained record for engagements that opt in.
4. **Don't summarize into brevity.** The entire point of this mechanism over `execution_log.md` is that it isn't limited to a 120-character line — write the real detail.

## Auto-Delegation

Follow `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` before proceeding. The gate reads `artifacts.omni_model.generate`; while batches are still being written that field is `in_progress`. Treat a batch present in `batches_complete` as meeting the gate for that batch.

```
⚠️  DATA SAFETY REMINDER

Omni: reads and validates the MODEL BRANCH only. No merge, no edit to the
  published model.

Warehouse: one smoke query per topic runs through the branch, LIMIT 10.
  Record the count of queries run; they count against the release budget's
  warehouse_spend line under the release director model.
```

---

# Omni Model: Validate

## Purpose

Proves that a batch of emitted Omni YAML is not only well formed but usable: Omni's own validator reports nothing blocking, every field the plan says is in scope exists on the branch, and every topic answers a query. Lint (`/wire:omni-model-lint`) runs first and offline; this command is the first step that spends CLI and warehouse calls, so it refuses to start while lint is absent or failing.

## Prerequisites

- `migration/omni_model/lint_<batch_id>.md` exists for the batch with overall PASS
- Omni CLI configured against the target profile (`omni whoami whoami` succeeds)
- `bi_migration.omni_branch` set in status.md

## Inputs

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/migration/omni_model/<batch_id>/**`
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/migration/omni_model/<batch_id>/needs_human.json`
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/migration/omni_model/lint_<batch_id>.md`
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/looker_model_catalog.csv` (in-scope fields: rows for this batch's views with `translation_class` `mechanical` or `assisted`)
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/migration/bi_migration_batches.csv`
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/status.md`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Resolve the batch and confirm lint

`--batch <id>`, or `--all` for every batch in `batches_complete`, or the batch named in `artifacts.omni_model.lint_batch`. For each batch, read `migration/omni_model/lint_<batch_id>.md`. If the file is missing or its overall result is FAIL, stop:

```
Lint has not passed for batch <batch_id>. Run /wire:omni-model-lint $ARGUMENTS --batch <batch_id> first.
```

### Step 2: Run validation checks

**Check 1: Omni validator, no blocking issues**
```bash
omni models validate <bi_migration.omni_model_id> --branch-id <bi_migration.omni_branch>
```
PASS when no returned issue has `is_warning: false`. FAIL listing each blocking issue with its file and message. Warnings are recorded in the report but do not fail the check.

**Check 2: Every emitted file is on the branch, once**
For each emitted `.view`, `.topic` and the `relationships.yaml`, `omni models yaml-get ... --branch-id ... --mode extension` returns content matching the local file, and `omni models get-views <modelId>` lists each view exactly once. FAIL names any file missing, different, or duplicated.

**Check 3: Every in-scope field exists**
From `audit/looker_model_catalog.csv`, take every dimension, dimension_group and measure row whose view is in this batch and whose `translation_class` is `mechanical` or `assisted`. Each must exist on the branch as a field of the emitted view (a dimension group becomes one dimension with timeframes; a `tier` becomes a dimension with `bin_boundaries`). A `redesign` row is not expected and its absence is correct. FAIL names each missing field with its class.

**Check 4: Assisted emissions confirmed**
Every `needs_human.json` item with `emitted: true` is confirmed one of three ways and the item's `status` is updated: `confirmed` (the field validated in Check 1 and answers in Check 5), `changed` (the consultant edited the YAML and re-wrote it to the branch, recorded on the item), or `parked` (turned into a parked decision). An item still `open` after this step is FAIL.

**Check 5: One smoke query per topic**
For each emitted topic, run one query through the branch: the topic's base view count measure (or its first measure) grouped by its first dimension, `limit: 10`:
```bash
omni query run --body '{"query": {"table": "<base_view>", "fields": ["<view>.<dimension>", "<view>.<measure>"], "limit": 10, "sorts": [], "filters": {}, "pivots": [], "calculations": [], "column_totals": {}, "row_totals": {}, "fill_fields": [], "userEditedSQL": "", "join_paths_from_topic_name": "<topic>"}, "branchId": "<bi_migration.omni_branch>"}'
omni query wait --job-ids <jobId>
```
PASS when the job completes, returns at least one row, and `missing_fields` is empty. A topic returning zero rows is a FAIL with reason `empty_topic` unless the plan records the source table as empty. Record the number of queries run.

**Check 6: needs_human open count matches**
`artifacts.omni_model.needs_human_open` in status.md equals the number of `open` items across the batch's `needs_human.json` after Check 4. FAIL on mismatch.

### Step 3: Write the validation section

Append to `migration/omni_model/omni_model.md`:

```markdown
## Validation: batch b01

| Check | Result | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Omni validator | PASS | 0 blocking, 3 warnings |
| 2 Files on branch | PASS | 18/18 |
| 3 In-scope fields | FAIL | 2 missing: orders.margin_pct (assisted), customers.tenure_band (mechanical) |
| 4 Assisted confirmed | PASS | 5 confirmed, 1 changed, 0 parked |
| 5 Topic smoke queries | PASS | 3/3 topics, 3 queries run |
| 6 needs_human count | PASS | 2 |

Gaps to address: ...
```

### Step 4: Update status

```yaml
artifacts:
  omni_model:
    validate: pass | fail        # overall: pass only when every batch in batches_complete has passed
    validated_date: "{{TODAY}}"
    batches_validated: [b01]     # batches with a PASS on their latest run
    smoke_queries_run: N         # cumulative this release, for the budget line
```

Overall `validate: pass` requires every batch in `batches_complete` to appear in `batches_validated`. When `--batch` validates one batch of several, set `validate: in_progress` unless that condition holds.

### Step 5: Output next command

If PASS (overall):
```
/wire:omni-model-review $ARGUMENTS
```

If the batch passed but others remain:
```
Batch <batch_id> validated. Batches still to validate: <ids>.
Content for this batch may start: /wire:omni-content-generate $ARGUMENTS --batch <content batch id>
```

If FAIL:
```
Validation failed for batch <batch_id>. Address the gaps listed above, rewrite the changed files to the branch, then re-run:
/wire:omni-model-lint $ARGUMENTS --batch <batch_id>
/wire:omni-model-validate $ARGUMENTS --batch <batch_id>
```

## Output Files

- Updated `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/migration/omni_model/omni_model.md`
- Updated `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/migration/omni_model/<batch_id>/needs_human.json` (item statuses)
- Updated `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/status.md`

## Post-Execution Hooks

After updating `status.md`, run these in sequence:

1. **Execution log**: append one row to `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/execution_log.md` following `specs/utils/execution_log.md`.

2. **Jira sync**: follow `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `omni_model` as artifact, `validate` as action.

3. **Document store**: follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `omni_model` as artifact_id, `Omni Model` as artifact_name, and the `file` value from `artifacts.omni_model` in status.md as file_path.

4. **Auto-commit**: follow `specs/utils/commit.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as release_folder, `omni_model` as artifact, `validate` as action.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

---
description: Internal utility — appends a log entry to the project's execution log after any generate/validate/review workflow or skill activation
---

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail | By | Session |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|----|---------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> | <by> | <session> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition, or an advisory gate satisfied by a director's ruling
  - `mode` — the director handed control over or took it back ("you drive" / "I'll drive"), per `specs/utils/director_operating_model.md`
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason
  - For a ruling-satisfied advisory gate: the precondition and the ruling id
- **By**: the git user (`git config user.name`), or `unknown` if git has no
  user configured. Who the run is attributable to, regardless of what typed it.
- **Session**: what invoked the run. One of:
  - `typed` — a person typed the command
  - `orchestrator` — the orchestrating session dispatched it, followed by its
    session id in brackets where one is available: `orchestrator [a1b2c3]`
  - a lane label — the lane that ran it, e.g. `dbt-developer [staging 1/2]`
  - `autopilot` — `/wire:autopilot` ran it

  This is the same value the `invoked_by` telemetry property carries
  (`specs/utils/telemetry.md`), read from `WIRE_INVOKED_BY` and defaulting to
  `typed`. The log records it per row so the record on disk answers the same
  question telemetry answers in aggregate.

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> | <by> | <session> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Stale Status Check

Immediately after appending a **command** row (this does not apply to skill activation entries), perform a quick freshness check against the project's `status.md`. This is additive to the logging behavior above — it never blocks the calling command and never modifies `status.md`.

**Process**:
1. Derive `artifact_id` from the command just logged: strip the `/wire:` prefix and the trailing `-generate`, `-validate`, or `-review` suffix (e.g. `/wire:migration-inventory-generate` → `migration_inventory`). If the command doesn't map to a recognizable artifact (e.g. `/wire:new`, `/wire:status`, `/wire:archive`), skip this check entirely.
2. Read the artifact's own block in `status.md`: `artifacts.<artifact_id>`.
3. Check whether that artifact has already passed its review/approval gate — its `review` field (or equivalent approval field) shows `pass`, `approved`, or `complete`.
4. If the gate has passed, scan every field in the `artifacts.<artifact_id>` block for a value that is still the literal string `TBD`, or an empty list (`[]`) / `null` where the artifact's own template expects a populated value (i.e. the field is not legitimately optional).
5. For each stale field found, emit a one-line warning in the command's output:
   ```
   ⚠ status.md still shows `<field>: TBD` for `<artifact_id>` despite review: pass — status may be stale
   ```
   Emit one warning per stale field — do not suppress after the first.
6. After the last warning (only when at least one was emitted), add one closing line offering the repair path:
   ```
   Run /wire:status-sync <release-folder> to reconcile the record (see specs/utils/status_sync.md).
   ```
   The offer is informational only — never block the calling command and never run the sync automatically.
7. If no stale fields are found, the review/approval gate has not yet passed, or `artifact_id` could not be derived: no output, proceed silently.

This check is self-contained within this utility, so every caller gets it automatically without any caller-side changes.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries, and never
   re-order them. A row is appended at the bottom, always. Rewriting the file
   to insert a row in timestamp order is a modification, not an append.
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
6. **Timestamps must not go backwards.** Because rows are appended in the order
   things happened, each row's timestamp is greater than or equal to the row
   above it. A row whose timestamp precedes its predecessor's means either the
   clock moved or a row was inserted out of order; both are record defects.
   `/wire:status-sync` flags them, naming both rows. This does not block any
   command — the log is written either way, and the flag is a repair prompt.
7. **Single writer in orchestrated mode.** When
   `specs/utils/director_operating_model.md`'s operating model is in force,
   only the orchestrating session appends to this file. Lanes write their own
   state files and the orchestrator writes the log rows from them (rule 6 of
   the operating model). Outside orchestrated mode, every command writes its
   own row as it always has.

## Legacy five-column rows

Logs written before the `By` and `Session` columns existed have four data
columns. They stay valid and are never rewritten:

- A reader parses columns positionally and treats a missing `By` or `Session`
  as unknown. It does not treat a five-column row as malformed and does not
  backfill it.
- The two columns are added on the next write. A file whose header still has
  four columns gets the new header written once, at the point the first
  six-column row is appended; existing rows are left as they are, so a log can
  legitimately hold both shapes.
- Nothing derives meaning from the absence of the columns. An old row is not
  "typed"; it is unknown.
