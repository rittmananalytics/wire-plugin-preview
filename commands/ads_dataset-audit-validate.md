# Verify dataset audit completeness and tier classifications

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command

# Agentic Data Stack — Dataset Audit Validate

## Purpose

Check that the dataset audit is complete, the near-duplicate detection is sound, and the governance tier classifications are defensible. Produce a PASS/FAIL report before the audit goes to stakeholder review.

## Usage

```bash
/wire:ads_dataset-audit-validate YYYYMMDD_client_agentic_data_stack
```

## Prerequisites

- `dataset_audit.generate: complete` in status.md
- `.wire/<release-folder>/artifacts/dataset_audit.md` exists

## Validation Checks

### Completeness Checks

- [ ] Table count matches warehouse information_schema row count (within 5% — some views/temp tables expected to differ)
- [ ] Every domain mentioned in the SOW or engagement context is represented
- [ ] Every table in the audit has a tier classification (Semantic / Curated / Raw)
- [ ] Every near-duplicate group has exactly one canonical candidate identified
- [ ] Governance grade assigned to every domain

### Near-Duplicate Quality Checks

- [ ] No canonical candidate is a raw or undocumented table (unless no managed alternative exists — must be noted)
- [ ] Duplicate groups are genuinely overlapping, not just similarly named tables with different grain
- [ ] All tables flagged for deprecation have a documented canonical replacement
- [ ] No table is flagged for deprecation without a stated justification

### Tier Classification Checks

- [ ] Semantic tier: every table classified Semantic has a verifiable metric definition in the semantic layer
- [ ] Curated tier: every table classified Curated has evidence of dbt management (appears in `dbt ls` output or has a documented schema.yml entry)
- [ ] Raw tier: tables classified Raw are not primary query targets in recent query history (if query_audit has run)

### Governance Grade Calibration

- [ ] Grade A domains genuinely have >80% semantic layer coverage
- [ ] Grade D domains have documented evidence of widespread duplication
- [ ] No domain is graded higher than C if it has undocumented canonical tables

## Automated Checks

Where possible, run these automatically:

```bash
# Check every table in the audit has a tier classification
grep -c "| Semantic \|| Curated \|| Raw " artifacts/dataset_audit.md

# Check no canonical candidate is raw
grep -A2 "Canonical — retain" artifacts/dataset_audit.md | grep -i "raw\|undocumented" && echo "WARNING: Raw table marked canonical"

# Check all duplicate groups have a recommendation
grep -c "Recommendation:" artifacts/dataset_audit.md
```

## Output Format

```markdown
## Dataset Audit Validation

**Result: PASS / FAIL / PASS WITH WARNINGS**

### Checks Run: N
### Checks Passed: N
### Checks Failed: N

### Failed Checks

| Check | Detail | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| Curated tier without dbt evidence | `revenue_summary` classified Curated but not in dbt ls output | High |

### Warnings

| Warning | Detail |
|---|---|
| Canonical candidate is undocumented | `orders_combined` marked canonical for orders domain but has no schema.yml entry |

### Recommended Actions Before Review

1. Verify `revenue_summary` dbt management status
2. Add schema.yml documentation for `orders_combined` before proceeding to canonical_models phase
```

## Status Update

```yaml
dataset_audit:
  validate: complete
  validate_date: YYYY-MM-DD
  validation_result: pass  # pass | pass_with_warnings | fail
  checks_run: N
  checks_passed: N
```

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
