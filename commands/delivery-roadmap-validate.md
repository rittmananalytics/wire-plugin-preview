# Validate the delivery roadmap and Release 1 scope

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command

# Delivery Roadmap — Validate

## Purpose

Checks the delivery roadmap is complete and that Release 1 scope is realistic against the commercial envelope.

## Inputs

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/planning/delivery_roadmap.md`
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/planning/requirements_matrix.md`
- `engagement/sow.md`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Locate

Resolve `$ARGUMENTS`. Read inputs.

### Step 2: Section completeness

- [ ] Objectives (3–5 bullets, business-outcome framed)
- [ ] Scope overview with explicit in/out (✅/❌)
- [ ] Breakdown of Release 1 requirements (table populated)
- [ ] Recommendations table (≥ 3 rows, all with named owner + priority)
- [ ] All three Delivery Options present (Build, Pair, Coach)
- [ ] Each option has all 7 dimensions filled
- [ ] Comparison table populated
- [ ] Release 1 plan summary (sprints, go-live, team, dependencies)
- [ ] Discovery exit checklist present

### Step 3: Preferred option check

- [ ] If `sponsor_validation.preferred_delivery_option` is set, the matching option is named as the headline / recommended option in the document
- [ ] If null, the document presents all three as equal and flags "Sponsor decision required"

### Step 4: Scope realism

- [ ] Release 1 row count vs sprint capacity: row count / sprint count ≤ 4 rows per sprint week (flag WARNING if higher — likely over-scoped)
- [ ] Each Phase 1 row in the matrix appears in the breakdown table (no silent drops)
- [ ] Out-of-scope items (`Phase: Future` and `MoSCoW: Won't`) are listed in the Scope overview as ❌

### Step 5: Commercial sanity

- [ ] At least one delivery option has a sprint count and team allocation that fits the SoW contract value (rough sanity check — RA day rate × allocation × sprint length × sprint count)
- [ ] Named client-side dependencies have a contact owner

### Step 6: Produce report

**Output**: `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/planning/delivery_roadmap_validation.md`

```markdown
# Delivery Roadmap Validation Report

**Release**: $ARGUMENTS
**Date**: {{TODAY}}

## Result: PASS / FAIL / PASS WITH WARNINGS

## Section completeness

| Check | Result | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Objectives | ✅ | 4 bullets, business-outcome framed |
| Scope overview | ✅ | |
| Release 1 breakdown | ✅ | 18 rows |
| Recommendations table | ✅ | 5 rows, owners + priorities |
| Delivery Options | ✅ | All three present |
| Comparison table | ✅ | |
| Release 1 plan summary | ⚠️ | Go-live date missing |
| Exit checklist | ✅ | |

## Preferred option

Sponsor named: Pair
Document headline: Pair ✅

## Scope realism

- Release 1 rows: 18
- Sprint count (Pair option): 5 sprints × 2 weeks
- Rows per sprint week: 1.8 ✅

## Commercial sanity

[…]

## Next Steps

[If PASS]:
Sponsor review of the roadmap:
/wire:delivery-roadmap-review $ARGUMENTS

[If FAIL]:
Fix issues and re-validate.
```

### Step 7: Update status

```yaml
artifacts:
  delivery_roadmap:
    validate: complete   # or "failed"
```

## Output Files

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/planning/delivery_roadmap_validation.md`
- Updated `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/status.md`

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
