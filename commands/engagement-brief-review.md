# Engagement Brief — Review

## Purpose

Internal RA review of the engagement brief. Unlike most Wire `review` actions, this one is **not** sponsor-facing — the engagement brief is an internal artefact. The reviewer is the Head of Delivery (or a peer Lead Consultant), and the goal is to catch framing or scope problems before the consultant walks into the sponsor kick-off.

## Inputs

**Required**:
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/planning/engagement_brief.md`
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/planning/engagement_brief_validation.md` (if present)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Locate the brief

Resolve `$ARGUMENTS`. Read both files above. If validation report is missing, prompt the user to run `/wire:engagement-brief-validate $ARGUMENTS` first.

### Step 2: Pull meeting context

Follow `specs/utils/meeting_context.md`:
- Search Fathom transcripts for the sales-process meetings tied to this engagement (typically labelled with the client name and pre-dating the SoW signature)
- Surface any decisions, concerns, or commitments the sales team captured that the brief may have missed

If a document store is configured, follow `specs/utils/docstore_fetch.md` to pull any reviewer comments on the Confluence/Notion copy.

### Step 3: Present for review

Output the brief content followed by the meeting context. Then ask using `AskUserQuestion`:

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "What is the outcome of the internal RA review of the engagement brief?",
    "header": "Engagement Brief Review",
    "options": [
      {"label": "Approved", "description": "Brief is solid — ready to walk into the kick-off"},
      {"label": "Approved with edits", "description": "Small corrections needed; apply them inline"},
      {"label": "Needs rework", "description": "Framing or scope problems — regenerate before kick-off"},
      {"label": "Scope changed", "description": "The client has clarified or changed the engagement scope materially"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
}
```

### Step 4: Collect reviewer feedback

Ask directly in chat:
```
Please provide any feedback, corrections, or coaching to record:
(Type "none" if no additional feedback)
```

### Step 5: Apply edits or record feedback

- **Approved with edits**: apply specific text corrections inline to `engagement_brief.md`.
- **Needs rework** or **Scope changed**: append a `## Review Feedback` section to the brief listing what needs to change. Do not rewrite — that requires a new generate cycle.

### Step 6: Update status

```yaml
artifacts:
  engagement_brief:
    review: complete    # or "pending_rework"
```

If rework is needed:
```yaml
artifacts:
  engagement_brief:
    generate: not_started
```

### Step 7: Output review summary

```
## Engagement Brief Review Complete

**Outcome**: [Approved / Approved with edits / Needs rework / Scope changed]
**Reviewer**: [Head of Delivery or peer Lead Consultant]
**Feedback recorded**: [yes/no]

### Next Steps

[If approved]:
Draft the stakeholder map:
/wire:stakeholder-map-generate $ARGUMENTS

[If rework needed]:
Update the engagement brief:
/wire:engagement-brief-generate $ARGUMENTS
```

### Step 8: Sync to document store (if approved)

If outcome is **Approved**, follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md` to overwrite the document store page with the canonical file.

## Output Files

- Updated `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/planning/engagement_brief.md` (if edits applied)
- Updated `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/status.md`

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
