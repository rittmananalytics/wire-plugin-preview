# Run full Droughty phase in sequence (discovery, post-dbt, or full)

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command

## Tracing (opt-in, off by default)

# Tracing — Detailed, Opt-In, Step-Level Execution Trace

## Purpose

`execution_log.md` records one terse row per whole command (timestamp, command, result, a detail string capped at 120 characters). That's enough for a normal audit trail, but it can't answer "what actually happened inside that command, step by step" — which specific files it read, what it inferred, what it proposed, what a consultant decided, why. Tracing exists for engagements that want that depth: a complete, structured, append-only record of every step of every command, scoped to the release and release type it ran under.

**Off by default.** Tracing never runs unless `WIRE_TRACE=true` is set in the shell environment. If it isn't, skip this entire section — do nothing, check nothing further, proceed straight to the Workflow Specification exactly as if this section didn't exist. This is the common case and must add zero overhead.

## Where it writes

`.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl` — one JSON object per line (JSON Lines), append-only, alongside that release's `status.md` and `execution_log.md`.

For commands not scoped to a specific release (cross-cutting utilities with `release_types: []` in their own front-matter, or any command whose argument isn't a release folder), write to `.wire/trace.jsonl` at the engagement level instead, with `release` and `release_type` fields set to `null`.

This file is **local only** — nothing in it is ever sent anywhere, unlike the anonymous Segment telemetry event described elsewhere. It stays on the consultant's machine, inside the engagement's own repo, exactly like `execution_log.md`.

## What to log, and when

If `WIRE_TRACE=true`:

1. **Resolve context once, before anything else**: the release folder (from this command's own argument, if it has one) and `release_type` (read `.wire/releases/<release_folder>/status.md`'s `project_type` or `release_type` field). If this command has no release-folder argument, both are `null`.
2. **Emit a `command_start` event** before beginning the Workflow Specification below.
3. **As you work through the Workflow Specification's own numbered steps, emit a `step` event after completing each one** — and where a step itself has meaningfully distinct numbered sub-parts (e.g. "check location A, then location B, then infer a match, then propose it"), treat each of those as its own step event too rather than collapsing them into one. The `detail` field has no length limit and is not a summary — write what actually happened: values found, files read, decisions made and why, what was proposed and what the consultant chose. If this step involved the data model registry or any other external/optional resource, log it explicitly: whether it was reached, what was searched, what matched (or didn't, and why not), and whether/how the result was used downstream.
4. **Emit a `command_end` event** when the workflow finishes, with the same `result` value this command would write to `execution_log.md` (`complete`, `pass`, `fail`, `approved`, etc.).

## How to emit an event

Use this pattern for every event (adjust the heredoc body and the Python literals per call — this is a template, not a fixed script):

```bash
[ "${WIRE_TRACE:-false}" = "true" ] && {
  mkdir -p ".wire/releases/<release_folder>" 2>/dev/null
  cat > "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt" << 'WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF'
<the full, untruncated detail text for this event — safe to include quotes,
newlines, code snippets, anything; this heredoc is not shell-interpreted>
WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF
  python3 -c "
import json, datetime
detail = open('/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt').read().rstrip('\n')
event = {
    'ts': datetime.datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'),
    'release': '<release_folder_or_null>',
    'release_type': '<release_type_or_null>',
    'command': 'droughty-generate',
    'event': '<command_start|step|command_end>',
    'step': '<step_number_or_null>',
    'step_name': '<step_heading_or_null>',
    'result': '<result_value_or_null>',
    'detail': detail,
}
with open('.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl', 'a') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(event) + chr(10))
"
  rm -f "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt"
}
```

- `<release_folder_or_null>` / `<release_type_or_null>`: from Step 1 above; write the literal JSON `null` (no quotes) if either doesn't apply, or a quoted string if it does.
- `event`: `command_start`, `step`, or `command_end`.
- `step` / `step_name`: `null` for `command_start`/`command_end`; the step's own number (e.g. `"1.5"`) and heading (e.g. `"Check for a Canonical Vertical Match"`) for a `step` event.
- `result`: `null` except on `command_end`.
- Adjust the file path in the final `open(...)` call to `.wire/trace.jsonl` for engagement-level (non-release-scoped) commands.

## Rules

1. **Never block or fail the workflow.** If a trace write fails for any reason (disk full, permissions), continue the workflow regardless — trace failures are never surfaced to the user and never stop anything.
2. **Append only** — never rewrite or delete existing lines in `trace.jsonl`.
3. **This is additive to `execution_log.md` and Telemetry, not a replacement for either.** All three continue exactly as documented elsewhere; tracing is a separate, optional, much finer-grained record for engagements that opt in.
4. **Don't summarize into brevity.** The entire point of this mechanism over `execution_log.md` is that it isn't limited to a 120-character line — write the real detail.

# Droughty Generate Command

Follow `specs/utils/dbt_developer_delegate.md` before executing the workflow below.

## Purpose

Orchestrate all Droughty commands in the correct sequence for the current engagement context. Skips commands that are already complete and commands that are not applicable (e.g. `lookml` when no LookML project is configured, `stage` when warehouse is Snowflake).

Two modes:

- **Discovery/audit mode** (default for `droughty` release type): runs setup → introspect → dbml → docs → qa. Used when the primary goal is mapping and assessing an existing warehouse. Does not require dbt to have been deployed.
- **Post-dbt mode**: runs setup → dbt-tests → stage → lookml → docs → qa. Used after `dbt run` within a `full_platform` or `dbt_development` release. Droughty reads the deployed schema to generate the base layer for the semantic layer phase.

## Usage

```bash
/wire:droughty-generate <release-folder>
```

Pass `--mode discovery` or `--mode post-dbt` to force a specific mode. Without the flag, the command determines mode from context.

## Prerequisites

Varies by mode — see individual command specs. Minimum: `.wire/engagement/context.md` exists and the warehouse is accessible.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine Mode

Read `.wire/releases/[release]/status.md`.

**If `project_type: droughty`** or `droughty.context: discovery` in status.md:
- Default to **discovery mode**

**If called within another release type** (e.g. `full_platform`, `dbt_development`):
- Ask in chat:
  ```
  What context is this Droughty run for?
  ```
  Use `AskUserQuestion`:
  ```json
  {
    "questions": [{
      "question": "What is the Droughty phase context?",
      "header": "Mode",
      "options": [
        {"label": "Discovery / audit", "description": "Map and assess an existing warehouse — no dbt deployment needed. Runs: introspect, dbml, docs, qa."},
        {"label": "Post-dbt deploy", "description": "Generate base layer from deployed dbt models. Runs: dbt-tests, stage (BigQuery), lookml, docs, qa."},
        {"label": "Full sequence", "description": "Run everything in order — setup, introspect, dbml, dbt-tests, stage, lookml, docs, qa. Requires dbt to be deployed."}
      ],
      "multiSelect": false
    }]
  }
  ```

### Step 2: Check What Is Already Complete

Read `droughty.*` blocks in `status.md`. Skip any step with `status: complete` unless `--force` is passed.

Show the planned sequence:

```
Droughty phase plan — [mode]:

  [✅ complete | ▷ will run | ⏭ skipping (not applicable)] droughty-setup
  [✅ complete | ▷ will run | ⏭ skipping (not applicable)] droughty-introspect
  [✅ complete | ▷ will run | ⏭ skipping (not applicable)] droughty-dbml
  [✅ complete | ▷ will run | ⏭ skipping (not applicable)] droughty-docs
  [✅ complete | ▷ will run | ⏭ skipping (not applicable)] droughty-qa
  [✅ complete | ▷ will run | ⏭ skipping (not applicable)] droughty-stage
  [✅ complete | ▷ will run | ⏭ skipping (not applicable)] droughty-dbt-tests
  [✅ complete | ▷ will run | ⏭ skipping (not applicable)] droughty-lookml

Proceed? (yes/no)
```

### Step 3: Execute Sequence

Run each planned step in order by invoking the corresponding spec:

**Discovery mode sequence:**
1. `specs/droughty/setup.md` (if not complete)
2. `specs/droughty/introspect.md`
3. `specs/droughty/dbml.md`
4. `specs/droughty/docs.md` (if OpenAI key available — skip with warning if not)
5. `specs/droughty/qa.md` (if OpenAI key available — skip with warning if not)

**Post-dbt mode sequence:**
1. `specs/droughty/setup.md` (if not complete)
2. `specs/droughty/dbt_tests.md`
3. `specs/droughty/stage.md` (BigQuery only — skip with note if Snowflake)
4. `specs/droughty/lookml.md` (if LookML project configured — skip with note if not)
5. `specs/droughty/docs.md` (if OpenAI key available)
6. `specs/droughty/qa.md` (if OpenAI key available)

**Full sequence:**
1–8 in the order listed above.

If any step fails, stop and surface the error. Do not proceed to the next step — partial completion is tracked in `status.md` so the sequence can be resumed.

### Step 4: Final Summary

After all planned steps complete:

```
## Droughty Phase Complete ✅

[mode] mode — [release]

Artifacts generated:
  [✅] schema_inventory.md       — [n] tables, [n] columns
  [✅] [schema].dbml             — [n] tables, [n] relationships
  [✅] field_descriptions/       — [n] columns documented
  [✅] qa_report.md              — [n] checks, [n] issues flagged
  [✅] stg_*.sql + sources.yml   — [n] staging models
  [✅] views/generated/*.lkml    — [n] base LookML views

All artifacts: .wire/releases/[release]/artifacts/droughty/

### Next Steps

[If discovery mode]:
  /wire:problem-definition-generate [release]   — Generate problem definition from Droughty evidence
  /wire:pitch-generate [release]                — Shape the engagement as a pitch

[If post-dbt mode]:
  /wire:semantic_layer-generate [release]       — Extend Droughty base views with business logic
  /wire:semantic_layer-validate [release]
  /wire:semantic_layer-review [release]

[If within a full_platform or dbt_development release]:
  Continue with the semantic layer phase — Droughty artifacts are available to the AI context.
```

## Output

This command invokes each sub-command in sequence, with all outputs as documented in the individual command specs.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.
