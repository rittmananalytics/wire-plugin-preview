# Validate dbt model translations compile on target profile

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command
- `specs/<path>.md` references are shared workflow docs shipped with this plugin — read them from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/specs/<path>.md`. If the path matches a Wire command (e.g. `specs/requirements/generate.md`), it means that command (`/wire:requirements-generate`) and its spec is already embedded in the command file.

## Tracing (opt-in, off by default)

description: Internal utility — opt-in step-level execution tracing to .wire/releases/<release>/trace.jsonl when WIRE_TRACE=true
---

# Tracing — Detailed, Opt-In, Step-Level Execution Trace

## Purpose

`execution_log.md` records one terse row per whole command (timestamp, command, result, a detail string capped at 120 characters). That's enough for a normal audit trail, but it can't answer "what actually happened inside that command, step by step" — which specific files it read, what it inferred, what it proposed, what a consultant decided, why. Tracing exists for engagements that want that depth: a complete, structured, append-only record of every step of every command, scoped to the release and release type it ran under.

**Off by default.** Tracing never runs unless `WIRE_TRACE=true` is set in the shell environment. If it isn't, skip this entire section — do nothing, check nothing further, proceed straight to the Workflow Specification exactly as if this section didn't exist. This is the common case and must add zero overhead.

## Where it writes

`.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl` — one JSON object per line (JSON Lines), append-only, alongside that release's `status.md` and `execution_log.md`.

For commands not scoped to a specific release (cross-cutting utilities with `release_types: []` in their own front-matter, or any command whose argument isn't a release folder), write to `.wire/trace.jsonl` at the engagement level instead, with `release` and `release_type` fields set to `null`.

This file is **local only** — nothing in it is ever sent anywhere, unlike the anonymous Segment telemetry event described elsewhere. It stays on the consultant's machine, inside the engagement's own repo, exactly like `execution_log.md`.

## What to log, and when

If `WIRE_TRACE=true`:

1. **Resolve context once, before anything else**: the release folder (from this command's own argument, if it has one) and `release_type` (read `.wire/releases/<release_folder>/status.md`'s `project_type` or `release_type` field). If this command has no release-folder argument, both are `null`.
2. **Emit a `command_start` event** before beginning the Workflow Specification below.
3. **As you work through the Workflow Specification's own numbered steps, emit a `step` event after completing each one** — and where a step itself has meaningfully distinct numbered sub-parts (e.g. "check location A, then location B, then infer a match, then propose it"), treat each of those as its own step event too rather than collapsing them into one. The `detail` field has no length limit and is not a summary — write what actually happened: values found, files read, decisions made and why, what was proposed and what the consultant chose. If this step involved the data model registry or any other external/optional resource, log it explicitly: whether it was reached, what was searched, what matched (or didn't, and why not), and whether/how the result was used downstream.
4. **Emit a `command_end` event** when the workflow finishes, with the same `result` value this command would write to `execution_log.md` (`complete`, `pass`, `fail`, `approved`, etc.).

## How to emit an event

Use this pattern for every event (adjust the heredoc body and the Python literals per call — this is a template, not a fixed script):

```bash
[ "${WIRE_TRACE:-false}" = "true" ] && {
  mkdir -p ".wire/releases/<release_folder>" 2>/dev/null
  cat > "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt" << 'WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF'
<the full, untruncated detail text for this event — safe to include quotes,
newlines, code snippets, anything; this heredoc is not shell-interpreted>
WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF
  python3 -c "
import json, datetime
detail = open('/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt').read().rstrip('\n')
event = {
    'ts': datetime.datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'),
    'release': '<release_folder_or_null>',
    'release_type': '<release_type_or_null>',
    'command': 'dbt-migration-validate',
    'event': '<command_start|step|command_end>',
    'step': '<step_number_or_null>',
    'step_name': '<step_heading_or_null>',
    'result': '<result_value_or_null>',
    'detail': detail,
}
with open('.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl', 'a') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(event) + chr(10))
"
  rm -f "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt"
}
```

- `<release_folder_or_null>` / `<release_type_or_null>`: from Step 1 above; write the literal JSON `null` (no quotes) if either doesn't apply, or a quoted string if it does.
- `event`: `command_start`, `step`, or `command_end`.
- `step` / `step_name`: `null` for `command_start`/`command_end`; the step's own number (e.g. `"1.5"`) and heading (e.g. `"Check for a Canonical Vertical Match"`) for a `step` event.
- `result`: `null` except on `command_end`.
- Adjust the file path in the final `open(...)` call to `.wire/trace.jsonl` for engagement-level (non-release-scoped) commands.

## Rules

1. **Never block or fail the workflow.** If a trace write fails for any reason (disk full, permissions), continue the workflow regardless — trace failures are never surfaced to the user and never stop anything.
2. **Append only** — never rewrite or delete existing lines in `trace.jsonl`.
3. **This is additive to `execution_log.md` and Telemetry, not a replacement for either.** All three continue exactly as documented elsewhere; tracing is a separate, optional, much finer-grained record for engagements that opt in.
4. **Don't summarize into brevity.** The entire point of this mechanism over `execution_log.md` is that it isn't limited to a 120-character line — write the real detail.

# dbt Migration — Validate

## Purpose

Validates that translated dbt models compile and pass basic structural checks against the target platform profile, and — when a target profile is accessible — that they build cleanly across **every rendered code path a model can take at deploy time**, not just a single default-target full-refresh compile. A `dbt parse`/`dbt run` pass on the default path is exactly what lets branch-only and test-only defects reach the client PR (see Check 5). Optionally runs `dbt build` (not `dbt run`) if the target profile is accessible.

## Flags

- `--batch N` — validate batch N only (default: current_batch in status.md). Reads `dbt_audit.csv`'s `batch_number` — the topological, finer-grained translation batch.
- `--wave <id>` — **the intended execution unit for a normal run.** Validate every dbt-model row `migration/migration_batching.csv` assigns to this wave (`batch_id`), cross-referenced against `dbt_audit.csv` for the actual model set — see **Step 0w** below. Accepts zero-padded (`B01`) or bare (`1`) forms, normalised identically to `dbt_migration-generate`'s and `dbt_migration-lint`'s `--wave`. Wave-id form and normalisation are the shared contract in `specs/utils/wave_resolution.md` (normative; accepts `2`, `B02`, `b2`, or the `W02` display form). `--wave` and `--batch` read different numbering schemes — abort if both are supplied: `[wire] --wave and --batch read different numbering schemes and cannot be combined. Pick one.`
- `--macros` — validate the batch-zero macro pass (`/wire:dbt-migration-generate --macros`) instead of a model batch. See **Macro Mode Checks** below. Standalone scope — abort if combined with `--batch` or `--wave`.
- `--snapshots` — **targeted snapshot scope.** `--snapshots` (bare) validates every snapshot object-type node (`object_type = snapshot` in the migration register / `audit/dbt_snapshots.csv`); `--snapshots name1,name2` only the named snapshots. Selection resolves against the snapshot object-type rows, never the model selector. When this is the scope, run **only Check 9** (the snapshot three-layer gate) over the selected snapshots and skip the model checks (Checks 1–8). This is the retrofit companion to `dbt-migration-generate --snapshots`. Normal `--batch`/`--wave` runs still run Check 9 over any in-scope snapshot inline; `--snapshots` is an additional targeted scope, not the only path. Standalone scope — abort if combined with `--batch`, `--wave`, `--model`, `--models`, `--select`, `--exclude`, or `--macros`: `[wire] --snapshots is a standalone scope. Run it on its own; do not combine with --batch/--wave/--model/--models/--select/--exclude/--macros.` See **Step 0s** below.
- `--config <path>` — load a per-run config overlay file overriding status.md-sourced fields (`migration.dbt_project_path`, `migration.target_platform`, etc.) for this invocation only — never written back to status.md. Mirrors `dbt_migration-generate`'s `--config` overlay exactly; see that spec's **Config overlay** section. Orthogonal to scope.
- `--tag-map <path>` / `--target-dataset <name>` / `--dbt-project-path <path>` — discrete single-field overlay shorthands (for `migration.pii_tag_map_path` / `migration.target_schema` / `migration.dbt_project_path` respectively). Mirror `dbt_migration-generate`'s equivalents exactly; see that spec's **Config overlay** section.

### Step 0 — Load config overlay, resolve project(s)
If `--config <path>` and/or `--tag-map`/`--target-dataset`/`--dbt-project-path` were supplied, load them exactly as `dbt_migration-generate` Step 0c describes — in-memory for this invocation only, `data_safety.production_projects` never overridable, discrete flags winning over `--config` on a per-key basis. Resolve the dbt project(s) at `migration.dbt_project_path` (or the overlay's equivalent) via `specs/utils/dbt_manifest_parse.md` Steps 1–2 (nested/multi-project aware) rather than assuming a single project directly at that path — this is what Check 5's `dbt compile` needs to run from the correct project directory in a monorepo, and what any check below needing the source manifest (e.g. resolving a model's source layer) reads from.

### Step 0w — Resolve `--wave` (only when `--wave` is used)
Identical resolution to `dbt_migration-generate`'s Step 1w: normalise the wave id, load `migration/migration_batching.csv` (abort if missing), filter to rows where `batch_id` matches and `object_type` is `dbt_model`, cross-reference `object_id` against `dbt_audit.csv`'s `model_name` to get the actual model set, and print the resolved-model preview before validating. The resolved set replaces "the batch" in every check below — Checks 1–9 run over it exactly as they run over a `--batch`-resolved set.

### Step 0s — Resolve `--snapshots` (only when `--snapshots` is used)
Resolve the selected snapshots against the **snapshot object-type nodes** only — the `object_type = snapshot` rows in `migration/migration_register.csv`, cross-referenced to `audit/dbt_snapshots.csv`. Never resolve against `dbt_audit.csv`'s model rows or the model selector. Bare `--snapshots` selects every snapshot node; `--snapshots name1,name2` selects only the named ones (a name that does not resolve to a snapshot node is listed as unresolved: `[wire] --snapshots: "<name>" is not a snapshot object-type node — check audit/dbt_snapshots.csv.`). Abort with `[wire] No snapshots matched --snapshots. Aborting.` if the resolved set is empty. Print the resolved-snapshot preview before validating. In this scope **only Check 9** runs, over the resolved snapshot set — Checks 1–8 (the model checks) are skipped.

## Validation Checks

Every check below reads "the batch" as whichever model set is in scope for this run — the `--batch`-resolved set, or the `--wave`-resolved set from Step 0w. The checks themselves are identical either way; only the resolved model list differs.

**Check 1 — Translated files exist for all models in batch**
Every model in the batch has a corresponding translated `.sql` file in `migration/dbt/`.
PASS/FAIL with gaps.

**Check 2 — No source-platform-specific functions remain**
Scan translated SQL for functions that exist only on the source platform (using feature_detection patterns). Any remaining source-platform functions that should have been translated are a FAIL.
PASS: No source-platform-only functions found.
FAIL: List functions and models.

**Check 3 — MANUAL REVIEW flags tracked**
Every `-- MANUAL REVIEW` comment in the translated SQL is listed in the batch summary file.
PASS: All flags tracked.
FAIL: Flags found in SQL not in summary.

**Check 4 — Jinja syntax is valid**
Scan translated Jinja for obvious syntax errors (unclosed tags, undefined variables).
PASS: No Jinja syntax errors.
FAIL: List models with errors.

**Check 5 — Build across every rendered code path (if target profile available)**

If `~/.dbt/profiles.yml` has a profile matching `migration.target_platform`, exercise **all** code paths a model can take at deploy time, not just one default-target full-refresh compile. Run everything below from whichever project directory Step 0 resolved for these models (a monorepo may resolve different models to different projects — run once per project the in-scope set touches, not once against a single assumed project root). Each sub-check is independently a FAIL; a model passes Check 5 only when every applicable sub-check passes.

**5a — Compile under every target profile the project defines.** Discover the target names — do **not** hardcode `dev`/`prod`. Read every entry under the resolved dbt profile's `outputs:` in `profiles.yml`, unioned with any target name referenced in the models/`dbt_project.yml` (e.g. `{% if target.name == '...' %}`). At minimum a dev and a prod-like target must be exercised; if the project defines only one, note "single target defined — cannot exercise `target.name` branches" so the reduced coverage is visible rather than assumed. For each discovered target `T`, run `dbt compile --select <in-scope models> --target T --profiles-dir ~/.dbt`. This is what catches a branch gated on `target.name` (e.g. a dev-only filter that references a SELECT alias or an unsupported function signature) — never compiled by a single-target run.
PASS: every in-scope model compiles under every discovered target. FAIL: list the model, the target, and the compile error.

**5b — Incremental models: build twice (initial then incremental).** For every in-scope model whose resolved config is `materialized: incremental`, run once to seed the relation (full refresh) and then again without `--full-refresh`, so the `is_incremental()` branch and its predicate are actually rendered and executed — a single build only ever renders the initial (non-incremental) branch.
PASS: both runs succeed for every incremental model. FAIL: list the model and which run (initial / incremental) failed, with the error. Note "no incremental models in scope" when none apply.

**5c — `dbt build`, not `dbt run`, so tests execute.** Run `dbt build --select <in-scope models> --target <prod-like target> --profiles-dir ~/.dbt` (build = run + test + snapshot + seed) so generic and singular tests execute. `dbt parse` and `dbt run` never execute tests, so an unported test macro, or a test referencing an unresolved `var`/`macro`, passes `parse` and fails only at `build` — on the client's CI. Fail if any referenced test, macro, or var is unresolved, or any test fails.
PASS: build succeeds and all tests pass. FAIL: list the failing/unresolved test, macro, or var per model.

If the target profile is not available, note "Check 5 skipped — target profile not configured" (not a FAIL) and record it as a coverage gap, since none of 5a–5c ran.

**Check 5 coverage report.** Emit a per-model coverage table into the batch/wave summary so a reviewer sees coverage rather than assuming it — one row per in-scope model with: targets compiled (5a, list the target names), incremental second run done (5b: yes / n/a), tests run (5c: count run / passed). A model with an empty coverage cell is not "clean", it is "unchecked on that surface" — say so explicitly.

**Check 6 — Diff files exist**
Every model in the batch has a `.diff.md` side-by-side diff file.
PASS/FAIL.

**Check 7 — Companion schema/properties YAML handled**
For every model in the batch that has a companion schema/properties YAML in the source project, the translation covers it:
- `sources.yml` referenced by the batch resolves to the target namespace (parameterised `database`/`schema`, or repointed) — not left pointing at the source platform.
- Singular/custom tests, `where:` filters, and `dbt_utils`/`dbt_expectations` arguments containing source-dialect SQL are translated (no source-platform-only functions remain in test SQL — same scan as Check 2, applied to tests).
- Any column-level `policy_tags` / masking `meta` is either authored into the YAML (dbt-managed) or explicitly recorded in the batch summary as deferred to the security workstream — not silently dropped.
PASS: All companion-YAML items handled or explicitly deferred. FAIL: List models with an un-repointed `sources.yml`, untranslated test SQL, or dropped policy-tag/meta config.

**Check 8 — Cross-market Bronze-column substitutions are flagged, not silently dropped**
This is the companion check to `dbt_migration-generate` Step 3.1 item b (the Bronze-schema existence check). For every translated model in the batch:
- Scan the translated SQL for a `CAST(NULL AS <type>)` carrying a `-- MARKET GAP:` inline comment (the marker `dbt_migration-generate` emits when a source column doesn't exist in every in-scope market).
- Confirm every such substitution is also named in the batch summary's "Source-to-ref substitutions and Bronze-schema gaps" section (model, column, synthesized type, affected market(s)).
- Confirm the reverse also holds: nothing in that batch-summary section is missing a matching `-- MARKET GAP:` comment in the SQL — a gap recorded in the summary but not flagged inline (or vice versa) is a defect either way.
PASS: every substitution is present in the SQL and tracked in the summary, and every tracked entry has a matching inline flag. FAIL: list models where the SQL and the summary disagree, naming the column and market. If `migration.target_markets` was unset for this engagement (Step 3.1 item b's single-market skip), note "not applicable — single-market engagement" rather than running the scan.

**Check 9 — Snapshot three-layer gate (SELECT-only row-equivalence is not sufficient)**
For every snapshot in scope (an `object_type = snapshot` row in the migration register / `audit/dbt_snapshots.csv`), a plain row-equivalence check on a SELECT is **explicitly rejected** as the pass criterion — it cannot see SCD-2 continuity. A snapshot passes only when **all three** layers pass; each layer independently gates. Read the SCD meta-column set and types from the active pair's **"Snapshot SCD mechanisms"** section.

- **9a — Copy-parity at `T`.** The target snapshot relation matches the source at the baseline: schema **including the four SCD meta columns** (`dbt_scd_id`, `dbt_updated_at`, `dbt_valid_from`, `dbt_valid_to`) and their ordinal order (payload first, meta columns at the tail in that order), row count, and a row-level checksum over the same pinned row set. For `rebuild_from_T` snapshots (recorded sign-off), copy-parity is not expected — assert instead that the target started fresh at `T` and record the sign-off reference.
- **9b — Continuation behaviour.** After the target `dbt snapshot` adopt-and-continue run: an unchanged upstream row opens **no** new version; a changed upstream row opens **exactly one** new version (prior version's `dbt_valid_to` closed, new version `dbt_valid_to` NULL); a hard-deleted upstream row is invalidated when `invalidate_hard_deletes: true`; and a **second** `dbt snapshot` run is idempotent (no new versions on unchanged input).
- **9c — SCD integrity.** `dbt_scd_id` is unique across the relation; `unique_key` and `dbt_valid_from` are not null; there is **no more than one open version** (`dbt_valid_to IS NULL`) per `unique_key`. Overlapping open versions per key is a FAIL.

PASS: every in-scope snapshot passes 9a, 9b, and 9c. FAIL: name the snapshot and the failing layer(s); a snapshot passing only a SELECT row-equivalence but failing any layer is a FAIL, not a pass. Note "no snapshots in scope" when none apply.

## Macro Mode Checks (`--macros`)

Run these instead of Checks 1–9 when `--macros` is supplied. Ground truth is `audit/batch_zero_plan.json` (the `layer: macro`, `action: translate` entries), re-read here rather than trusted from generate's summary.

**Check M1 — Every macro-layer entry has a translated file**
For every `layer: macro`, `action: translate` entry in `batch_zero_plan.json`, a translated definition exists under `migration/dbt/macros/` at the mirrored relative path. UDF-layer entries are explicitly out of scope (they are validated by `/wire:target-setup-validate`).
PASS/FAIL with gaps.

**Check M2 — No source-platform-specific functions remain in macro bodies**
Same scan as Check 2, applied to the translated macro files.
PASS/FAIL with functions and macros listed.

**Check M3 — Tier order is respected**
No translated macro references the *source-dialect* form of a lower-tier macro it depends on — a tier-N macro must call the already-translated tier-`<N` version. Rebuild the dependency tiers from `batch_zero_plan.json`.
PASS/FAIL with violations listed.

**Check M4 — MANUAL REVIEW flags and deferrals tracked**
Every `-- MANUAL REVIEW` comment in a translated macro, and every `compile: deferred` macro, is listed in `batch_zero_macros_summary.md`.
PASS/FAIL.

**Check M5 — Diff files exist**
Every translated macro has a `.diff.md`.
PASS/FAIL.

```


## Post-Execution Hooks

After updating `status.md`, run these in sequence:

1. **Execution log** — Append one row to `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/execution_log.md` following `specs/utils/execution_log.md`.

2. **Jira sync** — Follow `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `dbt_migration` as artifact, `validate` as action.

3. **Document store** — Follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `dbt_migration` as artifact_id, `dbt Migration` as artifact_name, and the `file` value from `artifacts.dbt_migration` in status.md as file_path.

4. **Auto-commit** — Follow `specs/utils/commit.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as release_folder, `dbt_migration` as artifact, `validate` as action.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

---
description: Internal utility — appends a log entry to the project's execution log after any generate/validate/review workflow or skill activation
---

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Stale Status Check

Immediately after appending a **command** row (this does not apply to skill activation entries), perform a quick freshness check against the project's `status.md`. This is additive to the logging behavior above — it never blocks the calling command and never modifies `status.md`.

**Process**:
1. Derive `artifact_id` from the command just logged: strip the `/wire:` prefix and the trailing `-generate`, `-validate`, or `-review` suffix (e.g. `/wire:migration-inventory-generate` → `migration_inventory`). If the command doesn't map to a recognizable artifact (e.g. `/wire:new`, `/wire:status`, `/wire:archive`), skip this check entirely.
2. Read the artifact's own block in `status.md`: `artifacts.<artifact_id>`.
3. Check whether that artifact has already passed its review/approval gate — its `review` field (or equivalent approval field) shows `pass`, `approved`, or `complete`.
4. If the gate has passed, scan every field in the `artifacts.<artifact_id>` block for a value that is still the literal string `TBD`, or an empty list (`[]`) / `null` where the artifact's own template expects a populated value (i.e. the field is not legitimately optional).
5. For each stale field found, emit a one-line warning in the command's output:
   ```
   ⚠ status.md still shows `<field>: TBD` for `<artifact_id>` despite review: pass — status may be stale
   ```
   Emit one warning per stale field — do not suppress after the first.
6. After the last warning (only when at least one was emitted), add one closing line offering the repair path:
   ```
   Run /wire:status-sync <release-folder> to reconcile the record (see specs/utils/status_sync.md).
   ```
   The offer is informational only — never block the calling command and never run the sync automatically.
7. If no stale fields are found, the review/approval gate has not yet passed, or `artifact_id` could not be derived: no output, proceed silently.

This check is self-contained within this utility, so every caller gets it automatically without any caller-side changes.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
