# Catalog dbt models with complexity classification and feature detection

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command
- `specs/<path>.md` references are shared workflow docs shipped with this plugin — read them from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/specs/<path>.md`. If the path matches a Wire command (e.g. `specs/requirements/generate.md`), it means that command (`/wire:requirements-generate`) and its spec is already embedded in the command file.

## Tracing (opt-in, off by default)

description: Internal utility — opt-in step-level execution tracing to .wire/releases/<release>/trace.jsonl when WIRE_TRACE=true
---

# Tracing — Detailed, Opt-In, Step-Level Execution Trace

## Purpose

`execution_log.md` records one terse row per whole command (timestamp, command, result, a detail string capped at 120 characters). That's enough for a normal audit trail, but it can't answer "what actually happened inside that command, step by step" — which specific files it read, what it inferred, what it proposed, what a consultant decided, why. Tracing exists for engagements that want that depth: a complete, structured, append-only record of every step of every command, scoped to the release and release type it ran under.

**Off by default.** Tracing never runs unless `WIRE_TRACE=true` is set in the shell environment. If it isn't, skip this entire section — do nothing, check nothing further, proceed straight to the Workflow Specification exactly as if this section didn't exist. This is the common case and must add zero overhead.

## Where it writes

`.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl` — one JSON object per line (JSON Lines), append-only, alongside that release's `status.md` and `execution_log.md`.

For commands not scoped to a specific release (cross-cutting utilities with `release_types: []` in their own front-matter, or any command whose argument isn't a release folder), write to `.wire/trace.jsonl` at the engagement level instead, with `release` and `release_type` fields set to `null`.

This file is **local only** — nothing in it is ever sent anywhere, unlike the anonymous Segment telemetry event described elsewhere. It stays on the consultant's machine, inside the engagement's own repo, exactly like `execution_log.md`.

## What to log, and when

If `WIRE_TRACE=true`:

1. **Resolve context once, before anything else**: the release folder (from this command's own argument, if it has one) and `release_type` (read `.wire/releases/<release_folder>/status.md`'s `project_type` or `release_type` field). If this command has no release-folder argument, both are `null`.
2. **Emit a `command_start` event** before beginning the Workflow Specification below.
3. **As you work through the Workflow Specification's own numbered steps, emit a `step` event after completing each one** — and where a step itself has meaningfully distinct numbered sub-parts (e.g. "check location A, then location B, then infer a match, then propose it"), treat each of those as its own step event too rather than collapsing them into one. The `detail` field has no length limit and is not a summary — write what actually happened: values found, files read, decisions made and why, what was proposed and what the consultant chose. If this step involved the data model registry or any other external/optional resource, log it explicitly: whether it was reached, what was searched, what matched (or didn't, and why not), and whether/how the result was used downstream.
4. **Emit a `command_end` event** when the workflow finishes, with the same `result` value this command would write to `execution_log.md` (`complete`, `pass`, `fail`, `approved`, etc.).

## How to emit an event

Use this pattern for every event (adjust the heredoc body and the Python literals per call — this is a template, not a fixed script):

```bash
[ "${WIRE_TRACE:-false}" = "true" ] && {
  mkdir -p ".wire/releases/<release_folder>" 2>/dev/null
  cat > "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt" << 'WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF'
<the full, untruncated detail text for this event — safe to include quotes,
newlines, code snippets, anything; this heredoc is not shell-interpreted>
WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF
  python3 -c "
import json, datetime
detail = open('/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt').read().rstrip('\n')
event = {
    'ts': datetime.datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'),
    'release': '<release_folder_or_null>',
    'release_type': '<release_type_or_null>',
    'command': 'dbt-audit-generate',
    'event': '<command_start|step|command_end>',
    'step': '<step_number_or_null>',
    'step_name': '<step_heading_or_null>',
    'result': '<result_value_or_null>',
    'detail': detail,
}
with open('.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl', 'a') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(event) + chr(10))
"
  rm -f "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt"
}
```

- `<release_folder_or_null>` / `<release_type_or_null>`: from Step 1 above; write the literal JSON `null` (no quotes) if either doesn't apply, or a quoted string if it does.
- `event`: `command_start`, `step`, or `command_end`.
- `step` / `step_name`: `null` for `command_start`/`command_end`; the step's own number (e.g. `"1.5"`) and heading (e.g. `"Check for a Canonical Vertical Match"`) for a `step` event.
- `result`: `null` except on `command_end`.
- Adjust the file path in the final `open(...)` call to `.wire/trace.jsonl` for engagement-level (non-release-scoped) commands.

## Rules

1. **Never block or fail the workflow.** If a trace write fails for any reason (disk full, permissions), continue the workflow regardless — trace failures are never surfaced to the user and never stop anything.
2. **Append only** — never rewrite or delete existing lines in `trace.jsonl`.
3. **This is additive to `execution_log.md` and Telemetry, not a replacement for either.** All three continue exactly as documented elsewhere; tracing is a separate, optional, much finer-grained record for engagements that opt in.
4. **Don't summarize into brevity.** The entire point of this mechanism over `execution_log.md` is that it isn't limited to a 120-character line — write the real detail.

## Automatic Validation (on by default)

---
description: Internal utility — injected auto-validate section so generate commands run their matching validate step automatically and fold the result into their output
---

Every `generate` command that has a matching `validate` command for the
same artifact runs that validate step automatically as part of generate —
by default, with no separate command to remember. This section only appears
on commands where that applies; artifacts with no separate validate step at
all (e.g. mockups, workshops, UAT) never carry this section.

## Step: Check `auto_validate`

Read this command's own `auto_validate` front-matter field, in the Workflow
Specification below. Two states:

- **Absent, or `true`** (the default — most artifacts): auto-validate runs.
- **`false`**: this artifact's validate step is expensive — it runs real
  code, queries a live warehouse or BI tool, or otherwise does IO beyond
  re-reading local files — so it does not run automatically. Skip to
  "If `auto_validate: false`" below.

## If `auto_validate` is absent or `true`: run validate automatically

Once this command finishes writing its artifact, before ending:

1. Run this artifact's own `/wire:<artifact-with-dashes>-validate` workflow
   in full, exactly as if the consultant had typed it themselves — same
   inputs, same `status.md` write to `artifacts.<artifact>.validate`, same
   report. This is not optional or an extra step layered on top; it is the
   default behavior for this artifact.
2. Fold the result into this command's own closing output rather than
   presenting it as a separate command run:
   - **PASS** — add a single closing line: `✅ Auto-validated — PASS`. The
     full report already went to `status.md`/`execution_log.md`, exactly as
     it would from a standalone validate run — no need to repeat it here.
   - **FAIL** — surface the validate command's own failure report in full,
     exactly as running validate standalone would show it, so the
     consultant sees what's wrong immediately without running anything
     else themselves.
3. This never blocks or undoes generate itself — the artifact is written
   either way, and its content is never rolled back because validate
   failed. Auto-validation only means validate has already run and its
   result is already on record by the time generate finishes, instead of
   waiting for the consultant to remember to run it separately.

## If `auto_validate` is `false`: state this plainly, don't run it

Do not run validate. End with a line naming why, as specifically as this
spec's own context makes possible (e.g. "runs `dbt run`/`dbt test`",
"queries the live target warehouse", "calls the Looker API directly") —
fall back to "performs live checks against an external system" only if no
more specific reason is evident from context:

```
⚠ This artifact's validate step [reason] and does not run automatically.
Run /wire:<artifact-with-dashes>-validate <release_folder> before
requesting review — review is blocked until it passes.
```

## Why this is always safe either way

`review` already requires `validate: PASS` for this same artifact as one of
its own declared preconditions (see `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md`) —
this is existing, independent enforcement, not something added by this
section. So an `auto_validate: false` opt-out never lets an artifact reach
review unvalidated; it only decides *when* the consultant pays validate's
cost — automatically on every draft (the default), or once, on their own
schedule, before requesting review (the opt-out). Auto-validation is a
convenience that closes the "forgot to run it" gap for the common case; the
gate that actually prevents unvalidated work from being reviewed was already
there.

# dbt Audit — Generate

## Purpose

Catalogs every model, source, test, macro, seed, and snapshot in the dbt project. Classifies each model by complexity based on SQL feature usage, line count, and dependency depth. Treats `enabled` as tri-state (`true` / `false` / `conditional:<var_name>`) rather than boolean, so a model that's only disabled because a flag defaulted off is never confused with one that's permanently out of scope. The audit also flags platform-specific macro usage across the macro layer and produces a batch-zero macro translation plan — the macros that must be translated before model batch 1 starts. The output drives the batching strategy for dbt_migration and the complexity weighting in the migration inventory.

## Prerequisites

- Release folder with `release_type: platform_migration` in `status.md`
- dbt project path accessible at `migration.dbt_project_path` (default: `./dbt`)

## Inputs

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/status.md` — dbt_project_path, source_platform
- dbt project files at `migration.dbt_project_path`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Locate the release and dbt project

Confirm `release_type: platform_migration`. Read `migration.dbt_project_path` (default: `./dbt`).

Run `specs/utils/dbt_manifest_parse.md` Step 1 (project resolution). If it hard-fails, stop here with the exact blocker message it produces — do not catch the failure and fall back to a prior artifact, another release's catalogue, or any cached file.

### Step 2: Parse the dbt manifest and build dependency graphs

Run `specs/utils/dbt_manifest_parse.md` Steps 2–5. Carry forward for the rest of this workflow:

- The resolved project list (path + package name per project)
- The model dependency graph (full node IDs, enabled models only)
- The macro dependency graph (macro→macro edges)
- The per-model transitive macro-usage set

If the utility used its text-scan fallback, mark every count and ordering below as medium confidence and record the fallback in the audit's Notes, per the utility spec.

### Step 3: Inventory project components

Walk each resolved project's filesystem directly. The manifest gives dependency edges; the filesystem is the ground truth for what exists — validate's disk-reconciliation check compares the catalogue against files on disk, so do not source the model list from the manifest alone.

**Models**: For each `.sql` (or `.py`) file under `models/`:
- File path and model name
- Layer (staging, intermediate, mart — inferred from path or prefix)
- Line count
- Number of `ref()` calls (upstream dependencies)
- Number of `source()` calls
- Number of CTEs
- SQL feature tags (see Step 4)
- `enabled` — per `specs/utils/dbt_manifest_parse.md` Steps 3 and 3b: `true` (statically enabled), `false` (statically disabled — confirmed no `var()` anywhere in the resolution path, not just absent from the manifest's `nodes`), or `conditional:<var_name>` (the config resolves via a `var()` — in scope regardless of what it currently evaluates to, never collapsed to `true` or `false`). On disk but absent from the manifest entirely → flag the model for investigation in the audit output rather than silently defaulting to `enabled=true`.

**Sources**: Count and list all sources defined in `schema.yml` files.

**Tests**: Count generic and singular tests. Note which models have no tests.

**Macros**: List all macros in each project's `macros/` directory. Platform-specific flagging happens in Step 5.

**Seeds**: List all seed files with row counts.

**Snapshots**: Catalog every dbt snapshot as its own object type — a snapshot is an SCD-2 history table, not a model, and if it falls through the model-only scan it is never audited, translated, or tested, which blocks the downstream models that read it and risks silently losing SCD-2 history. Scan the **snapshot-paths**: every `.sql` under each resolved project's `snapshot-paths:` directory (default `snapshots/`) and every `{% snapshot <name> %} … {% endsnapshot %}` block (a project may also define snapshots inside a `models/` tree via the block form — scan for the block, not just the directory). Record one row per snapshot with the **snapshot metadata schema**:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `snapshot_name` | the snapshot name (from the block header or file) |
| `file_path` | path to the snapshot file within its resolved project |
| `strategy` | `timestamp` or `check` (from the snapshot config) |
| `unique_key` | the `unique_key` config value |
| `updated_at` | the `updated_at` column (timestamp strategy) — else blank |
| `check_cols` | the `check_cols` value (check strategy): a column list or `all` — else blank |
| `invalidate_hard_deletes` | `true` / `false` (config; default `false`) |
| `target_schema` | the physical target relation the snapshot builds to (resolved `target_schema`/`target_database` + name), i.e. the built history table other models read |
| `upstream` | the `ref()`/`source()` the snapshot's inner SELECT reads from |
| `downstream_dependents` | comma-separated models/snapshots that `ref()` this snapshot |
| `feature_tags` | platform-specific SQL feature tags in the inner SELECT (same detection as models, Step 4) |

The SCD meta columns (`dbt_scd_id`, `dbt_updated_at`, `dbt_valid_from`, `dbt_valid_to`) and their per-pair types are declared in the platform pair's **"Snapshot SCD mechanisms"** section — do not restate the types here; the copy/translate/test commands read them from the pair.

**Analyses**: List any files in `analyses/`.

### Step 4: Detect platform-specific SQL features per model

For each model SQL file, apply the feature detection patterns from the platform pair file:

- BigQuery source: load `wire/platform_pairs/bigquery_to_snowflake/feature_detection.md`
- Snowflake source: load `wire/platform_pairs/snowflake_to_bigquery/feature_detection.md`

Tag each model with every feature pattern that matches. A model with no matches gets an empty tag list.

### Step 5: Detect platform-specific SQL in the macro layer

For every macro file across all resolved projects' `macros/` directories — plus any shared macros directory referenced in a `dbt_project.yml` `macro-paths:` entry or a sibling `shared/macros` directory — apply the same feature-detection patterns from Step 4 (including the macro-layer patterns: `create_function_udf`, `object_agg`, `within_group`, `colon_path`, `ilike`, `ilike_any`, `like_all`, `rlike`, `regexp_substr_multiarg`) to the macro's SQL body. Any macro with at least one hit joins the **NEEDS-translation set**.

Classify each NEEDS macro's `action`:

- `translate` (default) — a target-platform equivalent exists; the macro is rewritten in the batch-zero pass.
- `redesign` — no direct equivalent (e.g. a Snowpark or JavaScript UDF with no BigQuery analogue). Needs an architectural decision — surface at the human review gate, do not tier it.
- `manual-review-out-of-scope` — source-platform session, catalog, or dev-tooling operations (`ALTER SESSION`, external-table refresh, clone/drop schema and the like). Not model-build SQL; no target equivalent as written.

Treat the pattern match as a **shortlist**, then apply judgement per macro body to assign `action` and a coarse `category` tag (e.g. scalar-function, VARIANT/OBJECT_CONSTRUCT, fn_-UDF, ILIKE/RLIKE). This is feature-detection-rules-plus-review, not a one-shot mechanical scan. Record in the audit's Notes that the classification is a single specialist-pass read of every macro body — a floor count, not independently re-verified.

For every model, intersect its transitive macro-usage set (from Step 2) with the NEEDS set to populate that model's `platform_macros` value: comma-separated macro names, blank if none. Per the `dbt_manifest_parse.md` Step 5 caveat, schema-qualified UDF calls in model SQL are invisible to this intersection — `platform_macros` and any macro model-reach count is a floor for those macros.

### Step 6: Classify complexity

Assign each model a complexity rating:

**Simple**:
- ≤100 lines
- 0 platform-specific feature tags
- ≤3 upstream refs
- No window functions or recursive CTEs

**Moderate**:
- 101–300 lines, OR
- 1–3 platform-specific feature tags, OR
- 4–10 upstream refs, OR
- Uses window functions but no nested STRUCT/ARRAY operations

**Complex**:
- >300 lines, OR
- >3 platform-specific feature tags, OR
- >10 upstream refs, OR
- Uses UNNEST, STRUCT, FLATTEN, LATERAL, ML functions, or GEOGRAPHY operations

### Step 7: Build migration batches

Order buildable models — every model classified `true` **or** `conditional:<var_name>` — via a **topological sort** (Kahn's algorithm or DFS-based) over the model dependency graph from Step 2. Do not use `ref_count` or a depth-then-pack heuristic — `ref_count` is a count, not an edge, and the heuristic it drove produced hundreds of forward-reference violations. Every model's `ref()` parents must sit in an earlier-or-equal batch.

Sort key when multiple valid orderings exist:

1. A project that is `source()`'d by another resolved project sorts before the project that reads it
2. Topological layer (leaf-first depth in the dependency graph)
3. Simple before Moderate before Complex
4. Name

Pack into batches of at most 20 models, preserving that order. A parent and its child may share a batch — dbt builds in dependency order within a run, so this is safe; do not fragment into smaller batches just to force strict parent-in-an-earlier-batch.

**Snapshots are buildable nodes in the sort.** A dbt snapshot is a first-class build target with real edges — its `upstream` ref/source is a parent, and every model in its `downstream_dependents` is a child. Include each snapshot as a node in the topological sort with an **upstream→snapshot** edge from its ref/source parent and a **snapshot→dependent** edge to each downstream model, and assign it a `batch_number` like any other buildable node. This guarantees a snapshot sorts after the model it reads and before the models that read it, so no downstream model is ever ordered ahead of the snapshot it depends on. Record the snapshot's `batch_number` in the snapshot catalog.

**Conditional models.** A `conditional:*` model has no dependency edges in the default-var manifest sort — its edges come from `dbt_manifest_parse.md` Step 4's flags-on re-parse (place it in the sort like any other model once its real edges are known) or, when re-parsing wasn't available, the dependency-rule fallback (place it one batch after the highest batch of its in-scope dependencies, or in batch 1 if none of its dependencies are in scope). State in the audit's Notes which mode was used, and that the dependency-rule placement is exact only for single-parent leaf nodes.

Assign each buildable (`true` or `conditional:*`) model a `batch_number` (1-indexed). Only models classified **statically** `false` get a null `batch_number` and are excluded from batching — a `conditional:*` model always gets a real batch number, never null, regardless of what it resolves to under default vars.

Count forward references in the result (a model whose graph parent sits in a later batch). This should be 0 — state the count in the audit's Notes.

### Step 8: Generate the batch-zero macro translation plan

Restrict the macro dependency graph (from Step 2) to the NEEDS-translation set from Step 5, then compute tiers:

- **Tier 0** — NEEDS macros with no NEEDS-macro dependency
- **Tier N** — NEEDS macros that depend only on tiers <N

`redesign` and `manual-review-out-of-scope` macros are listed in their own buckets and get no tier.

**Assign each entry a `layer` — the lifecycle it belongs to.** The batch-zero pass is two different kinds of work, translated and deployed by two different commands, so every macro entry carries a `layer` field that routes it:

- `layer: "udf"` — the entry emits a warehouse `CREATE FUNCTION` object (deploy-once DDL): its name matches `create_udfs` or the `fn_*` prefix, or its detected category is `fn_-UDF`. These are deployed to the target by `/wire:target-setup-generate` (see that spec's UDF DDL step), tiered `tier 0 → tier 1 → create_udfs`.
- `layer: "macro"` — every other NEEDS macro: pure Jinja / dispatched SQL-dialect macros (`globalize_id`, `cross_dialect_helpers`, `ensure_*`, the scalar / VARIANT / ILIKE set). These are translated by `/wire:dbt-migration-generate --macros` and validated indirectly when the models that call them compile.

`redesign` and `manual-review-out-of-scope` UDF entries still carry `layer: "udf"` (with a null tier) so `target-setup-generate` can surface them at its safety-gate review as architecture decisions. The `layer` split is the discriminator both consuming commands route on — do not omit it.

Write:
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/batch_zero_plan.json` — from `TEMPLATES/migration/batch_zero_plan.json`
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/batch_zero_macro_plan.md` — from `TEMPLATES/migration/batch_zero_macro_plan.md`

Mark the output **provisional**, and carry both caveats into the markdown output's caveat callout: (1) the classification is a single specialist-pass read — a floor count, not independently re-verified; (2) schema-qualified UDF calls in model SQL are invisible to the scan, so UDF-layer model-reach figures and dependency edges understate reality.

State the rule in the plan: translate all of tier 0 (any order), then tier 1, then tier 2, etc. — entirely before model batch 1 begins. A widely-used macro can be referenced by 200+ models scattered across every batch; it must be rewritten once, up front.

### Step 9: Write the audit report and CSV

**Output locations**:
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/dbt_audit.md` — narrative report with summary statistics
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/dbt_audit.csv` — machine-readable model catalog
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/dbt_snapshots.csv` — machine-readable snapshot catalog (written only when the project defines snapshots)

Use the templates at `TEMPLATES/migration/dbt_audit.md`, `TEMPLATES/migration/dbt_audit.csv`, and `TEMPLATES/migration/dbt_snapshots.csv`.

**Snapshot catalog.** If the project defines any snapshots, write `dbt_snapshots.csv` with one row per snapshot in the snapshot metadata schema (Step 3), plus the `batch_number` assigned in Step 7:
`snapshot_name, file_path, strategy, unique_key, updated_at, check_cols, invalidate_hard_deletes, target_schema, upstream, downstream_dependents, feature_tags, batch_number`
and add a **Snapshots** section to `dbt_audit.md` — one row per snapshot naming its strategy, `unique_key`, `updated_at`/`check_cols`, `target_schema`, upstream ref/source, and downstream dependents. A snapshot with no downstream dependents is still cataloged (its history still matters); note it rather than dropping it.

The CSV must contain:
`model_name, file_path, layer, line_count, ref_count, source_count, cte_count, complexity, feature_tags, batch_number, has_tests, migration_notes, enabled, platform_macros`

The `enabled` column is tri-state, not boolean: `true`, `false`, or `conditional:<var_name>` — never collapse a var-driven model to `true` or `false`.

**Conditionally-enabled models section.** If any models are classified `conditional:*`, add a "Conditionally-enabled models (var-driven)" section to `dbt_audit.md` — a model whose `enabled` config resolves via a `var()` must be called out explicitly, not left to be inferred from the CSV. One row per conditional model:

| Model | Project(s) | `enabled` expression | `enabled` column | batch_number |
|-------|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------|

State per model: the source surface that produced it (in-model config vs folder-level `+enabled`), which dependency-graph mode placed its batch number (flags-on re-parse vs dependency-rule fallback, per `dbt_manifest_parse.md` Step 4), and confirmation that enabling the driving var(s) doesn't newly bring any other project-native model into scope beyond what's already listed (the completeness check from `dbt_manifest_parse.md` Step 3b).

### Step 10: Update status

```yaml
artifacts:
  dbt_audit:
    generate: complete
    file: audit/dbt_audit.md
    generated_date: "{{TODAY}}"
    model_count: N
    enabled_count: N
    disabled_count: N
    conditional_enabled_count: N
    simple_count: N
    moderate_count: N
    complex_count: N
    batch_count: N
    snapshot_count: N
    macro_count: N
    macros_needing_translation_count: N
    batch_zero_plan: audit/batch_zero_plan.json
    source_count: N
    test_count: N
```

`enabled_count` is `true`-classified models only; `conditional_enabled_count` is tracked separately — both are buildable and carry a `batch_number`, but they are not the same count, and folding conditional models into `enabled_count` would hide exactly the distinction this exists to preserve.

### Step 11: Output summary

Print: total models, breakdown by complexity, disabled-model count, conditionally-enabled model count (and list them by name if any), number of batches, snapshot count (and list them by name if any), macros needing translation, confirmation the batch-zero plan was generated, most common feature tags, and next command:

```
/wire:dbt-audit-validate $ARGUMENTS
```

## Output Files

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/dbt_audit.md`
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/dbt_audit.csv`
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/dbt_snapshots.csv` — snapshot catalog (only when the project defines snapshots)
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/batch_zero_plan.json`
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/batch_zero_macro_plan.md`
- Updated `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/status.md`


## Post-Execution Hooks

After updating `status.md`, run these in sequence:

1. **Execution log** — Append one row to `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/execution_log.md` following `specs/utils/execution_log.md`.

2. **Jira sync** — Follow `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `dbt_audit` as artifact, `generate` as action.

3. **Document store** — Follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `dbt_audit` as artifact_id, `dbt Audit` as artifact_name, and the `file` value from `artifacts.dbt_audit` in status.md as file_path.

4. **Auto-commit** — Follow `specs/utils/commit.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as release_folder, `dbt_audit` as artifact, `generate` as action.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

---
description: Internal utility — appends a log entry to the project's execution log after any generate/validate/review workflow or skill activation
---

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail | By | Session |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|----|---------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> | <by> | <session> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition, or an advisory gate satisfied by a director's ruling
  - `mode` — the director handed control over or took it back ("you drive" / "I'll drive"), per `specs/utils/director_operating_model.md`
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason
  - For a ruling-satisfied advisory gate: the precondition and the ruling id
- **By**: the git user (`git config user.name`), or `unknown` if git has no
  user configured. Who the run is attributable to, regardless of what typed it.
- **Session**: what invoked the run. One of:
  - `typed` — a person typed the command
  - `orchestrator` — the orchestrating session dispatched it, followed by its
    session id in brackets where one is available: `orchestrator [a1b2c3]`
  - a lane label — the lane that ran it, e.g. `dbt-developer [staging 1/2]`
  - `autopilot` — `/wire:autopilot` ran it

  This is the same value the `invoked_by` telemetry property carries
  (`specs/utils/telemetry.md`), read from `WIRE_INVOKED_BY` and defaulting to
  `typed`. The log records it per row so the record on disk answers the same
  question telemetry answers in aggregate.

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> | <by> | <session> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Stale Status Check

Immediately after appending a **command** row (this does not apply to skill activation entries), perform a quick freshness check against the project's `status.md`. This is additive to the logging behavior above — it never blocks the calling command and never modifies `status.md`.

**Process**:
1. Derive `artifact_id` from the command just logged: strip the `/wire:` prefix and the trailing `-generate`, `-validate`, or `-review` suffix (e.g. `/wire:migration-inventory-generate` → `migration_inventory`). If the command doesn't map to a recognizable artifact (e.g. `/wire:new`, `/wire:status`, `/wire:archive`), skip this check entirely.
2. Read the artifact's own block in `status.md`: `artifacts.<artifact_id>`.
3. Check whether that artifact has already passed its review/approval gate — its `review` field (or equivalent approval field) shows `pass`, `approved`, or `complete`.
4. If the gate has passed, scan every field in the `artifacts.<artifact_id>` block for a value that is still the literal string `TBD`, or an empty list (`[]`) / `null` where the artifact's own template expects a populated value (i.e. the field is not legitimately optional).
5. For each stale field found, emit a one-line warning in the command's output:
   ```
   ⚠ status.md still shows `<field>: TBD` for `<artifact_id>` despite review: pass — status may be stale
   ```
   Emit one warning per stale field — do not suppress after the first.
6. After the last warning (only when at least one was emitted), add one closing line offering the repair path:
   ```
   Run /wire:status-sync <release-folder> to reconcile the record (see specs/utils/status_sync.md).
   ```
   The offer is informational only — never block the calling command and never run the sync automatically.
7. If no stale fields are found, the review/approval gate has not yet passed, or `artifact_id` could not be derived: no output, proceed silently.

This check is self-contained within this utility, so every caller gets it automatically without any caller-side changes.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries, and never
   re-order them. A row is appended at the bottom, always. Rewriting the file
   to insert a row in timestamp order is a modification, not an append.
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
6. **Timestamps must not go backwards.** Because rows are appended in the order
   things happened, each row's timestamp is greater than or equal to the row
   above it. A row whose timestamp precedes its predecessor's means either the
   clock moved or a row was inserted out of order; both are record defects.
   `/wire:status-sync` flags them, naming both rows. This does not block any
   command — the log is written either way, and the flag is a repair prompt.
7. **Single writer in orchestrated mode.** When
   `specs/utils/director_operating_model.md`'s operating model is in force,
   only the orchestrating session appends to this file. Lanes write their own
   state files and the orchestrator writes the log rows from them (rule 6 of
   the operating model). Outside orchestrated mode, every command writes its
   own row as it always has.

## Legacy five-column rows

Logs written before the `By` and `Session` columns existed have four data
columns. They stay valid and are never rewritten:

- A reader parses columns positionally and treats a missing `By` or `Session`
  as unknown. It does not treat a five-column row as malformed and does not
  backfill it.
- The two columns are added on the next write. A file whose header still has
  four columns gets the new header written once, at the point the first
  six-column row is appended; existing rows are left as they are, so a log can
  legitimately hold both shapes.
- Nothing derives meaning from the absence of the columns. An old row is not
  "typed"; it is unknown.
