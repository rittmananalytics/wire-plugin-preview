# dbt Audit — Generate

## Purpose

Catalogs every model, source, test, macro, seed, and snapshot in the dbt project. Classifies each model by complexity based on SQL feature usage, line count, and dependency depth. Treats `enabled` as tri-state (`true` / `false` / `conditional:<var_name>`) rather than boolean, so a model that's only disabled because a flag defaulted off is never confused with one that's permanently out of scope. The audit also flags platform-specific macro usage across the macro layer and produces a batch-zero macro translation plan — the macros that must be translated before model batch 1 starts. The output drives the batching strategy for dbt_migration and the complexity weighting in the migration inventory.

## Prerequisites

- Release folder with `release_type: platform_migration` in `status.md`
- dbt project path accessible at `migration.dbt_project_path` (default: `./dbt`)

## Inputs

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/status.md` — dbt_project_path, source_platform
- dbt project files at `migration.dbt_project_path`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Locate the release and dbt project

Confirm `release_type: platform_migration`. Read `migration.dbt_project_path` (default: `./dbt`).

Run `specs/utils/dbt_manifest_parse.md` Step 1 (project resolution). If it hard-fails, stop here with the exact blocker message it produces — do not catch the failure and fall back to a prior artifact, another release's catalogue, or any cached file.

### Step 2: Parse the dbt manifest and build dependency graphs

Run `specs/utils/dbt_manifest_parse.md` Steps 2–5. Carry forward for the rest of this workflow:

- The resolved project list (path + package name per project)
- The model dependency graph (full node IDs, enabled models only)
- The macro dependency graph (macro→macro edges)
- The per-model transitive macro-usage set

If the utility used its text-scan fallback, mark every count and ordering below as medium confidence and record the fallback in the audit's Notes, per the utility spec.

### Step 3: Inventory project components

Walk each resolved project's filesystem directly. The manifest gives dependency edges; the filesystem is the ground truth for what exists — validate's disk-reconciliation check compares the catalogue against files on disk, so do not source the model list from the manifest alone.

**Models**: For each `.sql` (or `.py`) file under `models/`:
- File path and model name
- Layer (staging, intermediate, mart — inferred from path or prefix)
- Line count
- Number of `ref()` calls (upstream dependencies)
- Number of `source()` calls
- Number of CTEs
- SQL feature tags (see Step 4)
- `enabled` — per `specs/utils/dbt_manifest_parse.md` Steps 3 and 3b: `true` (statically enabled), `false` (statically disabled — confirmed no `var()` anywhere in the resolution path, not just absent from the manifest's `nodes`), or `conditional:<var_name>` (the config resolves via a `var()` — in scope regardless of what it currently evaluates to, never collapsed to `true` or `false`). On disk but absent from the manifest entirely → flag the model for investigation in the audit output rather than silently defaulting to `enabled=true`.

**Sources**: Count and list all sources defined in `schema.yml` files.

**Tests**: Count generic and singular tests. Note which models have no tests.

**Macros**: List all macros in each project's `macros/` directory. Platform-specific flagging happens in Step 5.

**Seeds**: List all seed files with row counts.

**Snapshots**: List all snapshots with their strategy (timestamp / check).

**Analyses**: List any files in `analyses/`.

### Step 4: Detect platform-specific SQL features per model

For each model SQL file, apply the feature detection patterns from the platform pair file:

- BigQuery source: load `wire/platform_pairs/bigquery_to_snowflake/feature_detection.md`
- Snowflake source: load `wire/platform_pairs/snowflake_to_bigquery/feature_detection.md`

Tag each model with every feature pattern that matches. A model with no matches gets an empty tag list.

### Step 5: Detect platform-specific SQL in the macro layer

For every macro file across all resolved projects' `macros/` directories — plus any shared macros directory referenced in a `dbt_project.yml` `macro-paths:` entry or a sibling `shared/macros` directory — apply the same feature-detection patterns from Step 4 (including the macro-layer patterns: `create_function_udf`, `object_agg`, `within_group`, `colon_path`, `ilike`, `ilike_any`, `like_all`, `rlike`, `regexp_substr_multiarg`) to the macro's SQL body. Any macro with at least one hit joins the **NEEDS-translation set**.

Classify each NEEDS macro's `action`:

- `translate` (default) — a target-platform equivalent exists; the macro is rewritten in the batch-zero pass.
- `redesign` — no direct equivalent (e.g. a Snowpark or JavaScript UDF with no BigQuery analogue). Needs an architectural decision — surface at the human review gate, do not tier it.
- `manual-review-out-of-scope` — source-platform session, catalog, or dev-tooling operations (`ALTER SESSION`, external-table refresh, clone/drop schema and the like). Not model-build SQL; no target equivalent as written.

Treat the pattern match as a **shortlist**, then apply judgement per macro body to assign `action` and a coarse `category` tag (e.g. scalar-function, VARIANT/OBJECT_CONSTRUCT, fn_-UDF, ILIKE/RLIKE). This is feature-detection-rules-plus-review, not a one-shot mechanical scan. Record in the audit's Notes that the classification is a single specialist-pass read of every macro body — a floor count, not independently re-verified.

For every model, intersect its transitive macro-usage set (from Step 2) with the NEEDS set to populate that model's `platform_macros` value: comma-separated macro names, blank if none. Per the `dbt_manifest_parse.md` Step 5 caveat, schema-qualified UDF calls in model SQL are invisible to this intersection — `platform_macros` and any macro model-reach count is a floor for those macros.

### Step 6: Classify complexity

Assign each model a complexity rating:

**Simple**:
- ≤100 lines
- 0 platform-specific feature tags
- ≤3 upstream refs
- No window functions or recursive CTEs

**Moderate**:
- 101–300 lines, OR
- 1–3 platform-specific feature tags, OR
- 4–10 upstream refs, OR
- Uses window functions but no nested STRUCT/ARRAY operations

**Complex**:
- >300 lines, OR
- >3 platform-specific feature tags, OR
- >10 upstream refs, OR
- Uses UNNEST, STRUCT, FLATTEN, LATERAL, ML functions, or GEOGRAPHY operations

### Step 7: Build migration batches

Order buildable models — every model classified `true` **or** `conditional:<var_name>` — via a **topological sort** (Kahn's algorithm or DFS-based) over the model dependency graph from Step 2. Do not use `ref_count` or a depth-then-pack heuristic — `ref_count` is a count, not an edge, and the heuristic it drove produced hundreds of forward-reference violations. Every model's `ref()` parents must sit in an earlier-or-equal batch.

Sort key when multiple valid orderings exist:

1. A project that is `source()`'d by another resolved project sorts before the project that reads it
2. Topological layer (leaf-first depth in the dependency graph)
3. Simple before Moderate before Complex
4. Name

Pack into batches of at most 20 models, preserving that order. A parent and its child may share a batch — dbt builds in dependency order within a run, so this is safe; do not fragment into smaller batches just to force strict parent-in-an-earlier-batch.

**Conditional models.** A `conditional:*` model has no dependency edges in the default-var manifest sort — its edges come from `dbt_manifest_parse.md` Step 4's flags-on re-parse (place it in the sort like any other model once its real edges are known) or, when re-parsing wasn't available, the dependency-rule fallback (place it one batch after the highest batch of its in-scope dependencies, or in batch 1 if none of its dependencies are in scope). State in the audit's Notes which mode was used, and that the dependency-rule placement is exact only for single-parent leaf nodes.

Assign each buildable (`true` or `conditional:*`) model a `batch_number` (1-indexed). Only models classified **statically** `false` get a null `batch_number` and are excluded from batching — a `conditional:*` model always gets a real batch number, never null, regardless of what it resolves to under default vars.

Count forward references in the result (a model whose graph parent sits in a later batch). This should be 0 — state the count in the audit's Notes.

### Step 8: Generate the batch-zero macro translation plan

Restrict the macro dependency graph (from Step 2) to the NEEDS-translation set from Step 5, then compute tiers:

- **Tier 0** — NEEDS macros with no NEEDS-macro dependency
- **Tier N** — NEEDS macros that depend only on tiers <N

`redesign` and `manual-review-out-of-scope` macros are listed in their own buckets and get no tier.

Write:
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/batch_zero_plan.json` — from `TEMPLATES/migration/batch_zero_plan.json`
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/batch_zero_macro_plan.md` — from `TEMPLATES/migration/batch_zero_macro_plan.md`

Mark the output **provisional**, and carry both caveats into the markdown output's caveat callout: (1) the classification is a single specialist-pass read — a floor count, not independently re-verified; (2) schema-qualified UDF calls in model SQL are invisible to the scan, so UDF-layer model-reach figures and dependency edges understate reality.

State the rule in the plan: translate all of tier 0 (any order), then tier 1, then tier 2, etc. — entirely before model batch 1 begins. A widely-used macro can be referenced by 200+ models scattered across every batch; it must be rewritten once, up front.

### Step 9: Write the audit report and CSV

**Output locations**:
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/dbt_audit.md` — narrative report with summary statistics
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/dbt_audit.csv` — machine-readable model catalog

Use the templates at `TEMPLATES/migration/dbt_audit.md` and `TEMPLATES/migration/dbt_audit.csv`.

The CSV must contain:
`model_name, file_path, layer, line_count, ref_count, source_count, cte_count, complexity, feature_tags, batch_number, has_tests, migration_notes, enabled, platform_macros`

The `enabled` column is tri-state, not boolean: `true`, `false`, or `conditional:<var_name>` — never collapse a var-driven model to `true` or `false`.

**Conditionally-enabled models section.** If any models are classified `conditional:*`, add a "Conditionally-enabled models (var-driven)" section to `dbt_audit.md` — a model whose `enabled` config resolves via a `var()` must be called out explicitly, not left to be inferred from the CSV. One row per conditional model:

| Model | Project(s) | `enabled` expression | `enabled` column | batch_number |
|-------|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------|

State per model: the source surface that produced it (in-model config vs folder-level `+enabled`), which dependency-graph mode placed its batch number (flags-on re-parse vs dependency-rule fallback, per `dbt_manifest_parse.md` Step 4), and confirmation that enabling the driving var(s) doesn't newly bring any other project-native model into scope beyond what's already listed (the completeness check from `dbt_manifest_parse.md` Step 3b).

### Step 10: Update status

```yaml
artifacts:
  dbt_audit:
    generate: complete
    file: audit/dbt_audit.md
    generated_date: "{{TODAY}}"
    model_count: N
    enabled_count: N
    disabled_count: N
    conditional_enabled_count: N
    simple_count: N
    moderate_count: N
    complex_count: N
    batch_count: N
    macro_count: N
    macros_needing_translation_count: N
    batch_zero_plan: audit/batch_zero_plan.json
    source_count: N
    test_count: N
```

`enabled_count` is `true`-classified models only; `conditional_enabled_count` is tracked separately — both are buildable and carry a `batch_number`, but they are not the same count, and folding conditional models into `enabled_count` would hide exactly the distinction this exists to preserve.

### Step 11: Output summary

Print: total models, breakdown by complexity, disabled-model count, conditionally-enabled model count (and list them by name if any), number of batches, macros needing translation, confirmation the batch-zero plan was generated, most common feature tags, and next command:

```
/wire:dbt-audit-validate $ARGUMENTS
```

## Output Files

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/dbt_audit.md`
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/dbt_audit.csv`
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/batch_zero_plan.json`
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/batch_zero_macro_plan.md`
- Updated `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/status.md`


## Post-Execution Hooks

After updating `status.md`, run these in sequence:

1. **Execution log** — Append one row to `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/execution_log.md` following `specs/utils/execution_log.md`.

2. **Jira sync** — Follow `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `dbt_audit` as artifact, `generate` as action.

3. **Document store** — Follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `dbt_audit` as artifact_id, `dbt Audit` as artifact_name, and the `file` value from `artifacts.dbt_audit` in status.md as file_path.

4. **Auto-commit** — Follow `specs/utils/commit.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as release_folder, `dbt_audit` as artifact, `generate` as action.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
