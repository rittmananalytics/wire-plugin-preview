# Validate pipeline design

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command

## Tracing (opt-in, off by default)

# Tracing — Detailed, Opt-In, Step-Level Execution Trace

## Purpose

`execution_log.md` records one terse row per whole command (timestamp, command, result, a detail string capped at 120 characters). That's enough for a normal audit trail, but it can't answer "what actually happened inside that command, step by step" — which specific files it read, what it inferred, what it proposed, what a consultant decided, why. Tracing exists for engagements that want that depth: a complete, structured, append-only record of every step of every command, scoped to the release and release type it ran under.

**Off by default.** Tracing never runs unless `WIRE_TRACE=true` is set in the shell environment. If it isn't, skip this entire section — do nothing, check nothing further, proceed straight to the Workflow Specification exactly as if this section didn't exist. This is the common case and must add zero overhead.

## Where it writes

`.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl` — one JSON object per line (JSON Lines), append-only, alongside that release's `status.md` and `execution_log.md`.

For commands not scoped to a specific release (cross-cutting utilities with `release_types: []` in their own front-matter, or any command whose argument isn't a release folder), write to `.wire/trace.jsonl` at the engagement level instead, with `release` and `release_type` fields set to `null`.

This file is **local only** — nothing in it is ever sent anywhere, unlike the anonymous Segment telemetry event described elsewhere. It stays on the consultant's machine, inside the engagement's own repo, exactly like `execution_log.md`.

## What to log, and when

If `WIRE_TRACE=true`:

1. **Resolve context once, before anything else**: the release folder (from this command's own argument, if it has one) and `release_type` (read `.wire/releases/<release_folder>/status.md`'s `project_type` or `release_type` field). If this command has no release-folder argument, both are `null`.
2. **Emit a `command_start` event** before beginning the Workflow Specification below.
3. **As you work through the Workflow Specification's own numbered steps, emit a `step` event after completing each one** — and where a step itself has meaningfully distinct numbered sub-parts (e.g. "check location A, then location B, then infer a match, then propose it"), treat each of those as its own step event too rather than collapsing them into one. The `detail` field has no length limit and is not a summary — write what actually happened: values found, files read, decisions made and why, what was proposed and what the consultant chose. If this step involved the data model registry or any other external/optional resource, log it explicitly: whether it was reached, what was searched, what matched (or didn't, and why not), and whether/how the result was used downstream.
4. **Emit a `command_end` event** when the workflow finishes, with the same `result` value this command would write to `execution_log.md` (`complete`, `pass`, `fail`, `approved`, etc.).

## How to emit an event

Use this pattern for every event (adjust the heredoc body and the Python literals per call — this is a template, not a fixed script):

```bash
[ "${WIRE_TRACE:-false}" = "true" ] && {
  mkdir -p ".wire/releases/<release_folder>" 2>/dev/null
  cat > "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt" << 'WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF'
<the full, untruncated detail text for this event — safe to include quotes,
newlines, code snippets, anything; this heredoc is not shell-interpreted>
WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF
  python3 -c "
import json, datetime
detail = open('/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt').read().rstrip('\n')
event = {
    'ts': datetime.datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'),
    'release': '<release_folder_or_null>',
    'release_type': '<release_type_or_null>',
    'command': 'pipeline_design-validate',
    'event': '<command_start|step|command_end>',
    'step': '<step_number_or_null>',
    'step_name': '<step_heading_or_null>',
    'result': '<result_value_or_null>',
    'detail': detail,
}
with open('.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl', 'a') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(event) + chr(10))
"
  rm -f "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt"
}
```

- `<release_folder_or_null>` / `<release_type_or_null>`: from Step 1 above; write the literal JSON `null` (no quotes) if either doesn't apply, or a quoted string if it does.
- `event`: `command_start`, `step`, or `command_end`.
- `step` / `step_name`: `null` for `command_start`/`command_end`; the step's own number (e.g. `"1.5"`) and heading (e.g. `"Check for a Canonical Vertical Match"`) for a `step` event.
- `result`: `null` except on `command_end`.
- Adjust the file path in the final `open(...)` call to `.wire/trace.jsonl` for engagement-level (non-release-scoped) commands.

## Rules

1. **Never block or fail the workflow.** If a trace write fails for any reason (disk full, permissions), continue the workflow regardless — trace failures are never surfaced to the user and never stop anything.
2. **Append only** — never rewrite or delete existing lines in `trace.jsonl`.
3. **This is additive to `execution_log.md` and Telemetry, not a replacement for either.** All three continue exactly as documented elsewhere; tracing is a separate, optional, much finer-grained record for engagements that opt in.
4. **Don't summarize into brevity.** The entire point of this mechanism over `execution_log.md` is that it isn't limited to a 120-character line — write the real detail.

# Pipeline Design Validation Command

## Purpose

Validate the generated pipeline architecture document and embedded Data Flow Diagram against quality standards:
- All source systems from requirements are addressed
- Replication strategy is specified for each source
- Data Flow Diagram is present, complete, and syntactically valid
- All in-scope conceptual model entities are traceable through the DFD
- Design decisions are documented (not silently resolved)
- Error handling and scheduling are specified

## Usage

```bash
/wire:pipeline_design-validate YYYYMMDD_project_name
```

## Prerequisites

- `pipeline_design`: `generate: complete`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Verify Pipeline Design Exists

1. Check `pipeline_design.generate == complete` in `status.md`
2. Check that `design/pipeline_architecture.md` exists

If not found:
```
Error: Pipeline design not yet generated.
Run: /wire:pipeline_design-generate <project_id>
```

### Step 2: Read Inputs

1. Read `design/pipeline_architecture.md`
2. Read `requirements/requirements_specification.md` (for source system and entity cross-check)
3. Read `design/conceptual_model.md` (to verify entity coverage in DFD)

### Step 3: Run Validation Checks

**Architecture Checks**:

| Check | Rule | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| Source system coverage | Every source system named in requirements appears in Section 1 | Critical |
| Replication strategy defined | Every source system has a replication method specified (no blanks) | Critical |
| Staging model names | All staging models follow `stg_<source>__<entity>` naming convention | Critical |
| Warehouse model names | All warehouse models follow `<entity>_fct` or `<entity>_dim` convention | Major |
| Error handling specified | Section 3.4 (Error Handling) is non-empty and covers failure detection and alerting | Major |
| Scheduling defined | Section 3.5 (Scheduling) specifies refresh cadences for all sources | Major |
| Design decisions documented | All trade-off decisions are listed as PD-N items, not silently resolved | Major |
| Technology stack complete | Section 6 lists all layers with technology choices | Info |
| Security/governance addressed | Section 7 covers PII handling and access controls | Info |

**Data Flow Diagram Checks**:

| Check | Rule | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| DFD present | Section 4 exists and contains a Mermaid `graph LR` or `graph TD` block | Critical |
| Source systems in DFD | Every source system from Section 1 appears as a node in the DFD | Critical |
| Entity coverage in DFD | Every in-scope entity from the conceptual model appears (directly or via a model) in the DFD | Critical |
| BI layer present | The DFD includes at least one Explore and one Dashboard node | Major |
| Subgraph labels | DFD uses `subgraph` blocks to group Source / Ingestion / Staging / Warehouse / BI layers | Major |
| Arrows are directional | All connections use `-->` (directed), not `---` (undirected) | Major |
| Node labels meaningful | Node labels contain system/model names, not generic placeholders (`<placeholder>`) | Major |
| Mermaid syntax valid | No unclosed subgraphs, malformed node definitions, or syntax errors | Critical |

### Step 4: Generate Validation Report

```
## Pipeline Design Validation: [PROJECT_NAME]

**Status**: PASS | FAIL
**Validated**: [date]

### Architecture Checks

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Source system coverage | ✅/❌ | |
| Replication strategy | ✅/❌ | |
| Staging model naming | ✅/❌ | [e.g. "stg_focus_notes should be stg_focus__student_notes"] |
| Warehouse model naming | ✅/⚠️ | |
| Error handling | ✅/⚠️ | |
| Scheduling | ✅/⚠️ | |
| Design decisions documented | ✅/⚠️ | |
| Technology stack | ✅/⚠️ | |
| Security/governance | ✅/⚠️ | |

### Data Flow Diagram Checks

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| DFD present | ✅/❌ | |
| Source systems in DFD | ✅/❌ | |
| Entity coverage in DFD | ✅/❌ | [e.g. "Enrolment entity from conceptual model not shown"] |
| BI layer present | ✅/⚠️ | |
| Subgraph labels | ✅/⚠️ | |
| Directional arrows | ✅/⚠️ | |
| Node labels meaningful | ✅/⚠️ | |
| Mermaid syntax valid | ✅/❌ | |

### Issues Found

[List each Critical and Major issue with location and suggested fix]

### Next Steps

[If PASS]:
  /wire:pipeline_design-review <project_id>

[If FAIL]:
  Fix issues in design/pipeline_architecture.md, then re-run:
  /wire:pipeline_design-validate <project_id>
```

### Step 5: Update Status

```yaml
pipeline_design:
  validate: pass | fail
  validated_date: [today]
```

### Step 6: Sync to Jira (Optional)

Follow the Jira sync workflow in `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`:
- Artifact: `pipeline_design`
- Action: `validate`
- Status: the validate state just written to status.md (pass/fail)

## Edge Cases

### Placeholder Text in DFD

If the DFD contains unreplaced `<placeholder>` text (e.g. `<System Name>`, `<entity>`), flag as Major — this indicates the DFD was not populated with project-specific values.

### Entity in Conceptual Model Has No Source

If a conceptual model entity does not appear anywhere in the DFD (no staging or warehouse node), flag as Critical — this means there is no defined path to bring that entity's data into the warehouse. It may indicate a data gap that needs to be resolved with the client.

### Multiple Replication Scenarios Still Open

If the pipeline design presents multiple scenarios (A/B/C) but no recommendation has been made and no design decision (PD-N) is recorded for the selection, flag as Major. The scenario must be resolved before development begins.

## Output

- Validation report (displayed to user)
- Updates `.wire/<project_id>/status.md` with validate result and date

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise

## Example

```markdown
