# Validate bulk copy runbook — tenant guard, two-stage gate, scoped service account

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command

# Bulk Copy Migration — Validate

## Validation Checks

Read `status.md` to confirm `migration.scope == tenant_carveout`, `method: runbook`, and `migration.tenant_predicate`. Read the bulk copy runbook and `audit/ingestion_audit.md`.

**Check 1 — All in-scope tables in the runbook**
The count of tables in the runbook matches the count of landed tables for connectors with `include_in_migration: true` in the ingestion audit.
PASS/FAIL with missing tables listed.

**Check 2 — Each table has a source→target destination mapping**
Every table step names the source Snowflake object and its target BigQuery dataset/table.
PASS/FAIL with gaps.

**Check 3 — Tenant guard on every extract**
Every source extract step includes `WHERE {migration.tenant_predicate}`, matching `migration.tenant_predicate` exactly. No step extracts unfiltered data.
PASS: predicate present and matching on all steps.
FAIL: any step missing the predicate or using a different predicate.

**Check 4 — Two-stage copy with validation gate**
Each table follows the pilot-partition → validation gate → remainder structure. The gate runs equivalency check 1 (row count) and check 6 (checksum), tenant-scoped, and Stage 2 is conditional on both passing.
PASS/FAIL with tables missing the gate.

**Check 5 — Scoped service account and tenant guard documented**
The runbook names a service account scoped to the extracted tenant's target project/dataset (and dedicated staging bucket for GCS-staged), and confirms the destination is `migration.target_project` and not in `data_safety.production_projects`.
PASS/FAIL.

**Check 6 — Credential rotation / staging checklist present**
The runbook includes a credential checklist (scoped SA key, GCS bucket access, target-only BigQuery grants).
PASS/FAIL.

**Check 7 — Source decommission deferred to cutover**
The runbook explicitly notes the source stays live and unmodified during the copy; decommission is deferred to the cutover phase.
PASS: note present.
FAIL: source decommission/deletion steps found in the copy runbook (should be in cutover).

**Check 8 — Post-copy validation steps present**
The runbook hands off to `/wire:equivalency-validate` for the full tenant-scoped seven-check pass once all tables are copied.
PASS/FAIL.

### Update status

```yaml
artifacts:
  bulk_copy_migration:
    validate: pass | fail
    validated_date: "{{TODAY}}"
```


## Post-Execution Hooks

After updating `status.md`, run these in sequence:

1. **Execution log** — Append one row to `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/execution_log.md` following `specs/utils/execution_log.md`.

2. **Jira sync** — Follow `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `bulk_copy_migration` as artifact, `validate` as action.

3. **Document store** — Follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `bulk_copy_migration` as artifact_id, `Bulk Copy Migration` as artifact_name, and the `file` value from `artifacts.bulk_copy_migration` in status.md as file_path.

4. **Auto-commit** — Follow `specs/utils/commit.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as release_folder, `bulk_copy_migration` as artifact, `validate` as action.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
