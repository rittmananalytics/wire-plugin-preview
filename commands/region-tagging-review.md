# Region Tagging — Review

## Purpose

The human adjudication gate for region tagging. `generate` produced candidates; this is where a person rules on them. The reviewer works the adjudication pile — every `shared-row-level` item and every low-confidence candidate — and decides, item by item, how it belongs to the carve-out. The tool never made that call; this gate does.

Confident-region and global-deferred items at high confidence are confirmed in bulk unless the reviewer flags one. The shared-row-level items are the real work: each needs a lineage trace and row inspection before it can be ruled in, split, or deferred.

## Prerequisites

- `migration/region_tagging.md` with `validate: pass`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load meeting context

Follow `specs/utils/meeting_context.md` to surface any Fathom recordings touching the carve-out region, market boundaries, or data-residency scope.

### Step 2: Present the tagging summary

Display:
- Target region and tenant predicate used
- Bucket counts: confident-region / shared-row-level / global-deferred
- The adjudication pile, grouped by bucket, each item with its signal and confidence score

Reaffirm to the reviewer that nothing has been included, excluded, or removed — these are candidates, and this gate is the first point where a scope decision is made.

### Step 3: Adjudicate the pile

For each **shared-row-level** item: review its lineage and a row sample, then rule:
- **carve in** — the target region's rows are extracted (record the row-level predicate to apply)
- **split** — the object is shared; define how the region's slice is separated
- **defer** — move to global-deferred for a later decision

For each **low-confidence** confident-region or global-deferred candidate: confirm the bucket or reassign it.

High-confidence confident-region and global-deferred items: confirm in bulk, or pull any individual item into the pile if the reviewer disagrees.

### Step 4: Apply adjudication and record decision

Update `region_tagging.md` (and the relevant `region_tags.csv` rows, e.g. reassigned buckets) to reflect the adjudicated outcomes. Append:

```markdown
## Review — Adjudication

**Internal reviewer**: {{RA_REVIEWER}}
**Client attendees**: {{CLIENT_NAMES}}
**Review date**: {{TODAY}}
**Target region**: {{REGION}}
**Decision**: approved | changes_requested

### Adjudicated items
[Per item: id, prior bucket, ruling (carve in / split / defer / reassign), and rationale]

### Open items
[Items still needing lineage/row inspection before strategy can proceed]
```

### Step 5: Update status

```yaml
artifacts:
  region_tagging:
    review: approved | changes_requested
    reviewed_by: "{{REVIEWER_NAME}}"
    reviewed_date: "{{TODAY}}"
```

### Step 6: Output next command

If approved:
```
/wire:migration-strategy-generate $ARGUMENTS
```

## Review Gate

This review is the point where region candidates become scope decisions. The carve-out strategy and the tenant-scoped bulk copy are built against the adjudicated tags. Re-running `region-tagging-generate` after this gate re-proposes candidates and requires re-adjudication.


## Post-Execution Hooks

After updating `status.md`, run these in sequence:

1. **Execution log** — Append one row to `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/execution_log.md` following `specs/utils/execution_log.md`.

2. **Jira sync** — Follow `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `region_tagging` as artifact, `review` as action.

3. **Document store** — Follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `region_tagging` as artifact_id, `Region Tagging` as artifact_name, and the `file` value from `artifacts.region_tagging` in status.md as file_path.

4. **Auto-commit** — Follow `specs/utils/commit.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as release_folder, `region_tagging` as artifact, `review` as action.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
