# Release Brief Review Command

## Purpose

Facilitates the formal client review and sign-off of the release brief. This is the contractual commitment — client sign-off on the release brief authorises the team to proceed to sprint planning and delivery. Records the outcome and updates the release status.

## Inputs

**Required**:
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/planning/release_brief.md` — must be validated

## Workflow

### Step 1: Locate and Read the Release Brief

Resolve release folder. Read `planning/release_brief.md`. Confirm validation has been run.

### Step 2: Retrieve Meeting Context

Follow `specs/utils/meeting_context.md` — search for transcripts mentioning the release brief, SOW, deliverables, or sign-off.

If a document store is configured, follow `specs/utils/docstore_fetch.md`:
- Pass `artifact_id`, `artifact_name`, `file_path`, and `project_id` for this artifact
- This retrieves any reviewer comments added to the document store page since generation, and flags any edits made directly to the document store version vs the canonical GitHub version
- Surface the returned "Document Store Context" block to the reviewer alongside Fathom and Confluence context

### Step 3: Present for Review

Output the full release brief content, prefaced with any meeting context.

Then use `AskUserQuestion`:

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "What is the outcome of the release brief review?",
    "header": "Release Brief Review",
    "options": [
      {"label": "Signed off — proceed to sprint planning", "description": "Client has approved the brief and authorised the team to begin"},
      {"label": "Approved with minor changes", "description": "Small wording corrections or clarifications needed — direction is confirmed"},
      {"label": "Scope change requested", "description": "Client wants to change deliverables, timeline, or budget — requires rework"},
      {"label": "On hold", "description": "Client needs more time or has internal approvals to complete before signing off"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
}
```

### Step 4: Collect Sign-off Details

Ask:
```
Record the sign-off details (approver name, date, any conditions or notes):
```

### Step 5: Update the Release Brief

Populate Section 12 (Sign-off) with the approver name and date. If minor changes were requested, apply them. Append a `## Review Record` section.

### Step 6: Update Release Status

```yaml
release_brief:
  review: "complete"   # or "pending_rework" / "on_hold"
```

### Step 7: Output Review Summary

```
## Release Brief Review Complete

**Outcome**: [Signed off / Changes requested / On hold]
**Signed by**: [approver name and role]

### Next Steps

[If signed off]:
Generate the sprint plan:
/wire:sprint-plan-generate [folder]

[If scope change]:
Update problem definition and pitch, then regenerate the release brief.

[If on hold]:
Follow up with client. Check back when approvals are complete.
```

### Step 8: Sync to Document Store (Optional)

If a document store is configured and the review outcome is **Approved**, follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md` to overwrite the document store page with the canonical file. This ensures the document store reflects the approved version.

- If the outcome is Changes Requested or Needs Discussion, do not overwrite — the document store retains the reviewed version for reference until the next generate run.

## Output Files

- Updated `.wire/releases/[folder]/planning/release_brief.md`
- Updated `.wire/releases/[folder]/status.md`

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
