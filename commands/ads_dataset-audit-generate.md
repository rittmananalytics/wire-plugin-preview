# Inventory warehouse tables, identify duplicates, grade governance maturity

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command

# Agentic Data Stack — Dataset Audit Generate

Follow `specs/utils/agentic_data_stack_delegate.md` before executing the workflow below.

## Purpose

Produce a complete inventory of tables in the client's warehouse, identify near-duplicate and redundant definitions, classify each table by governance tier, and grade the overall governance maturity per domain. This is the foundation for every downstream decision in the release — if the audit is shallow, the canonical model will be wrong.

## Usage

```bash
/wire:ads_dataset-audit-generate YYYYMMDD_client_agentic_data_stack
```

## Prerequisites

- `.wire/<release-folder>/status.md` exists with `project_type: agentic_data_stack`
- Warehouse access configured (BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks, or Redshift)
- dbt project path recorded in status.md (optional — enriches the audit with lineage)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read Context

1. Read `.wire/<release-folder>/status.md`
2. Note: `warehouse`, `bi_tool`, `semantic_layer`, `dbt_project_path`, `primary_domain`
3. Read `.wire/engagement/context.md` for business context and domain definitions
4. Read `.wire/engagement/sow.md` if present — SOW may name specific tables or subject areas

### Step 2: Discover Tables

Connect to the warehouse and enumerate all tables in the analytics schema(s). For each table, collect:

- Full table reference (project.dataset.table for BigQuery; database.schema.table for Snowflake)
- Row count and approximate size
- Last modified date
- Owner / creator (from information_schema where available)
- Column count and column names
- Description (from table metadata / dbt docs if available)

**BigQuery:**
```sql
SELECT
  table_catalog, table_schema, table_name,
  row_count, size_bytes, last_modified_time,
  ARRAY_AGG(column_name ORDER BY ordinal_position) AS columns
FROM `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_STORAGE
JOIN `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS USING (table_catalog, table_schema, table_name)
GROUP BY 1,2,3,4,5,6
ORDER BY table_schema, table_name
```

**Snowflake:**
```sql
SELECT
  table_catalog, table_schema, table_name, table_type,
  row_count, bytes, last_altered, table_owner, comment
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('INFORMATION_SCHEMA')
ORDER BY table_schema, table_name
```

If direct warehouse access is unavailable, ask the consultant to run the query and paste results, or provide a CSV export from their warehouse console.

### Step 3: Identify Near-Duplicates

Group tables by semantic similarity. Flag as near-duplicate when two or more tables share:

- Overlapping column sets (>70% column name overlap)
- Similar naming (same root word with different suffixes: `_v2`, `_new`, `_old`, `_copy`, `_bak`, `_legacy`, year suffixes)
- Same grain but different sources or transformation levels

For each duplicate group, identify the canonical candidate — typically the one with:
- Most recent modification date
- Highest row count
- Clearest naming (follows dbt three-layer convention or agreed naming standard)
- dbt-managed (prefer managed over ad-hoc)

### Step 4: Classify by Governance Tier

Assign each table to one of three tiers:

| Tier | Criteria | Agent routing |
|---|---|---|
| **Semantic** | Defined metric in semantic layer (MetricFlow, LookML, dbt SL) | Route here first — always |
| **Curated** | dbt-managed mart or staging model, documented, tested | Route here if no semantic metric |
| **Raw** | Unmanaged, undocumented, or staging-only tables | Last resort fallback |

### Step 5: Grade Governance Maturity Per Domain

Group tables by business domain (orders, customers, marketing, finance, logistics, product, etc.) and assign a maturity grade:

| Grade | Criteria |
|---|---|
| **A** | One canonical table per entity; semantic layer coverage >80%; documented; tested |
| **B** | Clear canonical table; partial semantic layer; documented; some tests |
| **C** | Multiple candidates for canonical; sparse documentation; few tests |
| **D** | Widespread duplication; no documentation; no semantic layer; raw tables primary |

### Step 6: Write Dataset Audit Document

Write `.wire/<release-folder>/artifacts/dataset_audit.md`:

```markdown
---
artifact: dataset_audit
generated: YYYY-MM-DD
status: draft
---

# Dataset Audit

## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Total tables discovered | N |
| Near-duplicate groups identified | N |
| Tables recommended for deprecation | N |
| Domains assessed | N |
| Overall governance grade | A/B/C/D |

## Domain Governance Grades

| Domain | Grade | Tables | Canonical Candidates | Issues |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| orders | B | 12 | fct_orders | 3 near-duplicates |
| ... | | | | |

## Near-Duplicate Groups

### [Group 1: Revenue Tables]

| Table | Rows | Last Modified | Assessment |
|---|---|---|---|
| orders_raw | 2.1M | 2024-11-01 | Raw — deprecate |
| revenue_v2 | 2.1M | 2024-09-15 | Stale copy — deprecate |
| fct_orders | 2.1M | 2025-03-01 | **Canonical — retain** |
| fct_orders_v3 | 1.8M | 2025-01-10 | Partial migration — deprecate |

**Recommendation:** Retain `fct_orders`. Deprecate `orders_raw`, `revenue_v2`, `fct_orders_v3` with 90-day sunset.

```

### Step 7: Update Status

```yaml
dataset_audit:
  generate: complete
  validate: not_started
  review: not_started
  generated_date: YYYY-MM-DD
  tables_discovered: N
  duplicate_groups: N
  domains_assessed: N
  overall_grade: B
```

### Step 8: Confirm and Suggest Next Steps

```
## Dataset Audit Generated ✓

Discovered N tables across N domains. Identified N near-duplicate groups 
affecting N tables. Overall governance grade: B.

**Highest-priority issues:**
- [Domain]: N competing definitions for [entity]
- [Domain]: Primary table undocumented, no dbt management

**Next steps:**
- /wire:ads_metric-audit-generate — inventory semantic layer coverage
- /wire:ads_query-audit-generate — analyse query history patterns
- /wire:ads_dataset-audit-validate — run automated checks on audit completeness
```

## Edge Cases

### No Direct Warehouse Access

If the consultant cannot provide direct SQL access, request a schema export:
- BigQuery: `bq ls --format=prettyjson project:dataset > schema.json`
- Snowflake: Information Schema CSV export from Snowflake console
- dbt: `dbt ls --output json` provides model inventory with metadata

Work from the export rather than blocking on access.

### Very Large Schemas (>500 tables)

Focus the audit on tables with >10,000 rows and tables modified in the last 12 months. Flag the tail of small/stale tables as "low-priority — likely safe to archive" rather than auditing individually.

### No dbt Project

If no dbt project exists, the governance grade ceiling is C — curated tier tables can only be identified by naming convention and metadata, not by lineage or test coverage. Note this explicitly and factor into the governance_design recommendations.

## Output

- `.wire/<release-folder>/artifacts/dataset_audit.md`
- Updated `status.md`

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
