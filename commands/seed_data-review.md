# Record stakeholder review of seed data

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command

# Seed Data Review Command

## Purpose

Record stakeholder feedback on the generated seed data. Captures approval or change requests and updates tracking. The reviewer should verify the seed data is realistic, domain-appropriate, and sufficient for initial dashboard visualization.

## Usage

```bash
/wire:seed_data-review YYYYMMDD_project_name
```

## Prerequisites

- `seed_data.validate` must be `pass` in status.md

## Workflow

### Step 1: Verify Prerequisites

**Process**:
1. Read `.wire/<project-folder>/status.md`
2. Verify `artifacts.seed_data.validate` is `pass`

If not met:
```
Error: Seed data must pass validation first.

Run: /wire:seed_data-validate <project>
```

### Step 2: Present Review Summary

**Process**:
1. Read `.wire/<project-folder>/dev/seed_data/README.md`
2. Read a sample of the seed CSV files (first 5-10 rows of each)
3. If a document store is configured, follow `specs/utils/docstore_fetch.md`:
   - Pass `artifact_id`, `artifact_name`, `file_path`, and `project_id` for this artifact
   - This retrieves any reviewer comments added to the document store page since generation, and flags any edits made directly to the document store version vs the canonical GitHub version
   - Surface the returned "Document Store Context" block to the reviewer alongside any other context
4. Present a summary:

```
## Seed Data Review

**Files:** [count] CSV seed files
**Total rows:** [count]

### Overview
[Summary from README.md]

### Sample Data Preview
[First few rows from key tables]

### Review Criteria
- Is the data realistic for the [client/domain] context?
- Are the value distributions reasonable?
- Is there enough data variety for meaningful dashboard visualizations?
- Are the entity names and categories domain-appropriate?
```

### Step 3: Collect Review Decision

Use `AskUserQuestion`:

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "What is the review decision for the seed data?",
    "header": "Review",
    "options": [
      {"label": "Approved", "description": "Seed data is realistic and sufficient for initial development"},
      {"label": "Changes requested", "description": "Seed data needs modifications before proceeding"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
}
```

If "Changes requested", ask in chat:
```
What changes are needed? Please describe the issues with the seed data.
```

### Step 4: Update Status

**Process**:
1. Read `status.md`
2. Update artifacts.seed_data section:

**If approved**:
```yaml
seed_data:
  generate: complete
  validate: pass
  review: approved
  reviewed_date: [today's date]
  reviewer: [reviewer name if provided]
```

**If changes requested**:
```yaml
seed_data:
  generate: complete
  validate: pass
  review: changes_requested
  reviewed_date: [today's date]
  reviewer: [reviewer name if provided]
  review_notes: [summary of requested changes]
```

3. Write updated status.md

### Step 5: Sync to Jira (Optional)

Follow the Jira sync workflow in `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`:
- Artifact: `seed_data`
- Action: `review`
- Status: the review state just written to status.md

### Step 6: Sync to Document Store (Optional)

If a document store is configured and the review outcome is **Approved**, follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md` to overwrite the document store page with the canonical file. This ensures the document store reflects the approved version.

- If the outcome is Changes Requested or Needs Discussion, do not overwrite — the document store retains the reviewed version for reference until the next generate run.

### Step 7: Confirm and Suggest Next Steps

**If approved**:
```
## Seed Data Review: Approved

### Next Steps
1. **Generate dbt project**: `/wire:dbt-generate <project>`
   The dbt project will use these seed files as its data source
```

**If changes requested**:
```
## Seed Data Review: Changes Requested

**Feedback:** [summary]

### Next Steps
1. **Regenerate seed data**: `/wire:seed_data-generate <project>`
2. Then re-validate: `/wire:seed_data-validate <project>`
3. Then re-review: `/wire:seed_data-review <project>`
```

## Output

This command updates `status.md` with the review outcome. No files are created.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
