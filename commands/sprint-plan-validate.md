# Sprint Plan Validate Command

## Purpose

Validates the sprint plan against the appetite budget, checks for 13-point stories (must be broken down), verifies all deliverables from the release brief are covered, and confirms the velocity assumptions are realistic.

## Inputs

**Required**:
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/planning/sprint_plan.md`
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/planning/release_brief.md` (for deliverable coverage check)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read Sprint Plan and Release Brief

Resolve release folder. Read both documents.

### Step 2: Run Validation Checks

#### Point estimation checks
- [ ] **No 13-point stories**: Scan all stories — flag any with 13+ points as requiring breakdown
- [ ] **Points sum to a reasonable total**: Total points ÷ daily velocity ≤ appetite in working days (+ 20% buffer is acceptable)
- [ ] **No 0-point stories**: Every story has a non-zero point estimate
- [ ] **Epic subtotals correct**: Each epic's subtotal matches the sum of its story points

#### Deliverable coverage
- [ ] **All deliverables covered**: Every deliverable in the release brief (Section 3) maps to at least one epic in the sprint plan
- [ ] **No orphaned epics**: Every epic in the sprint plan maps to a release brief deliverable

#### Structural checks
- [ ] **Sprint goals defined**: Each sprint has a sprint goal
- [ ] **Stories have owners**: At least 80% of stories have an assigned owner (or "TBD" with a plan to assign)
- [ ] **Definition of Done present**: The sprint plan includes a definition of done

#### Appetite budget check
- [ ] **Total points vs appetite**:
  - Small batch (1–2 weeks): total points should be ≤ 40 (8 hours × 5 points × 10 days, with buffer)
  - Big batch (6 weeks): total points should be ≤ 120 (5 points × 5 days × 6 weeks, with buffer)
  - Flag if total exceeds the appetite budget by >20%

### Step 3: Produce Validation Report

**Output location**: `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/planning/sprint_plan_validation.md`

```markdown
# Sprint Plan Validation Report

**Release**: [folder]
**Date**: [today's date]
**Total points**: [X]
**Appetite budget**: [Y points for small/big batch]
**Point budget utilisation**: [X/Y = Z%]

## Result: PASS / FAIL / PASS WITH WARNINGS

## Checks

| Check | Result | Note |
|-------|--------|------|
| No 13-point stories | ✅ PASS | |
| Points within appetite budget | ⚠️ WARNING | 118 points vs 120 point budget — tight but acceptable |
| All deliverables covered | ✅ PASS | |
| Sprint goals defined | ✅ PASS | |
| Definition of done present | ✅ PASS | |

## Issues to Resolve

[List any FAIL or WARNING items with specific remediation steps]

## Downstream Releases

## Next Steps

```

### Step 4: Update Release Status

```yaml
sprint_plan:
  validate: "complete"  # or "failed"
```

## Output Files

- `.wire/releases/[folder]/planning/sprint_plan_validation.md`
- Updated `.wire/releases/[folder]/status.md`

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
