- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command

## Workflow Specification

---
wire_schema: "1.0"
command: utility
artifact: ads_audit_all
domain: utils
release_types: []
action_type: utility
logs_execution: true
inputs:
  required:
    - name: release_folder

# Wire Utility — Analytics Audit All

## Purpose

Fan out all three agentic data stack audits (dataset_audit, metric_audit, query_audit) in parallel to reduce the time spent in the audit phase. The three audits are largely independent — running them sequentially adds unnecessary wall-clock time.

## Usage

```bash
/wire:ads-audit-all YYYYMMDD_client_agentic_data_stack
```

## Prerequisites

- `.wire/<release-folder>/status.md` with `project_type: agentic_data_stack`
- Warehouse access configured
- dbt project path available (enriches all three audits)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Confirm Prerequisites

Read status.md and confirm all three audits are `not_started`. If any are already complete, skip those and run only the remaining ones.

### Step 2: Cost and Token Prompt

Running three audits in parallel uses approximately 3× the tokens of a single audit. Present the trade-off:

```
## Analytics Audit — Parallel Run

Running all three audits in parallel will:
- Reduce audit phase from ~3 hours to ~1 hour
- Use approximately 3× more context tokens this session

Options:
A) Run all three in parallel (recommended — saves ~2 hours)
B) Run sequentially — dataset_audit first, then metric_audit, then query_audit
```

If the user selects B, run `/wire:ads_dataset-audit-generate`, then `/wire:ads_metric-audit-generate`, then `/wire:ads_query-audit-generate` in sequence.

### Step 3: Parallel Execution (Option A)

Invoke all three generate commands concurrently as subagents:

**Subagent 1 — Dataset Audit:**
Follow the full workflow in `agentic_data_stack/dataset_audit/generate.md`

**Subagent 2 — Metric Audit:**
Follow the full workflow in `agentic_data_stack/metric_audit/generate.md`

**Subagent 3 — Query Audit:**
Follow the full workflow in `agentic_data_stack/query_audit/generate.md`

All three write to separate artifact files — no conflicts.

### Step 4: Consolidate Results

After all three complete, output a consolidated audit summary:

```
## Analytics Audit Complete

All three audits completed successfully.

### Summary

| Audit | Key Finding |
|---|---|
| Dataset | N tables, N duplicate groups, overall grade: B |
| Metric | N metrics found, N conflicts, X% coverage |
| Query | N patterns, X% SL-covered today |

### Recommended Next Steps

1. /wire:ads_dataset-audit-validate — check audit completeness
2. /wire:ads_metric-audit-validate
3. /wire:ads_query-audit-validate
4. Then schedule three review sessions with domain stakeholders

Or proceed directly to reviews if you have high confidence in audit quality:
/wire:ads_dataset-audit-review → /wire:ads_metric-audit-review → /wire:ads_query-audit-review
```

## Output

- All three audit artifacts written
- Updated status.md for all three audits

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
