# Validate release brief against the pitch

## User Input

```text

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command

## Workflow Specification

---

  - discovery_shape_up
action_type: artifact
logs_execution: true

    - name: release_folder
      description: "Path to the release folder"
preconditions:
  - artifact: release_brief
    action: generate
    outcome: complete

## Auto-Delegation

Follow `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` before proceeding.

# Release Brief Validate Command

## Purpose

Validates that the release brief is consistent with the approved pitch, that all deliverables have clear acceptance criteria, that the budget and timeline are populated, and that the downstream release list is complete and actionable.

## Inputs

**Required**:
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/planning/release_brief.md`
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/planning/pitch.md` (for consistency check)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read Both Documents

Read `planning/release_brief.md` and `planning/pitch.md`. If either is missing, prompt the user to generate the missing document first.

### Step 2: Run Validation Checks

#### Section completeness
- [ ] Section 1 (Executive Summary) — present and non-empty
- [ ] Section 2 (Appetite and Timeline) — appetite matches the pitch's confirmed appetite; start date and end date present or marked TBD with a reason
- [ ] Section 3 (Deliverables) — at least 1 deliverable with acceptance criteria; acceptance criteria are specific and verifiable
- [ ] Section 4 (Downstream Releases) — present; at least 1 downstream release listed with type and scope summary
- [ ] Section 5 (Out of Scope) — at least 2 items matching the pitch's no-gos
- [ ] Section 6 (Assumptions) — at least 1 assumption listed
- [ ] Section 7 (Risks) — at least 1 risk listed
- [ ] Section 8 (Resources) — engagement lead named
- [ ] Section 9 (Budget) — not blank
- [ ] Section 10 (Dependencies) — present (even if "None")
- [ ] Section 12 (Sign-off) — table present with client sponsor role

#### Consistency with pitch
- [ ] **Appetite match**: Section 2 appetite matches pitch Section 2 appetite (after any review adjustment)
- [ ] **No-gos carried through**: Items in brief Section 5 cover the pitch's no-gos (brief may be more specific, but nothing should be dropped)
- [ ] **Downstream releases match**: Brief Section 4 matches pitch Section 8 (or explains deviations)
- [ ] **Success criteria**: Brief deliverable acceptance criteria can be mapped to pitch success criteria — nothing promised in the pitch is missing from the brief

#### Deliverable quality checks
- [ ] Each acceptance criterion is specific: can be verified as true or false
- [ ] No acceptance criterion uses vague language: "good quality", "fast enough", "user-friendly" (flag these)
- [ ] Each deliverable has an assigned owner

### Step 3: Produce Validation Report

**Output location**: `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/planning/release_brief_validation.md`

Report format follows the same structure as other Wire validation reports: result (PASS/FAIL/WARNINGS), check table, issues to resolve, next steps.

### Step 4: Update Release Status

```yaml
release_brief:
  validate: "complete"  # or "failed"
```

## Output Files

- `.wire/releases/[folder]/planning/release_brief_validation.md`
- Updated `.wire/releases/[folder]/status.md`

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
