# Classify in-scope items into region buckets for a tenant carve-out (candidates, never auto-removal)

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command
- `specs/<path>.md` references are shared workflow docs shipped with this plugin — read them from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/specs/<path>.md`. If the path matches a Wire command (e.g. `specs/requirements/generate.md`), it means that command (`/wire:requirements-generate`) and its spec is already embedded in the command file.

## Tracing (opt-in, off by default)

---
description: Internal utility — opt-in step-level execution tracing to .wire/releases/<release>/trace.jsonl when WIRE_TRACE=true
---

# Tracing — Detailed, Opt-In, Step-Level Execution Trace

## Purpose

`execution_log.md` records one terse row per whole command (timestamp, command, result, a detail string capped at 120 characters). That's enough for a normal audit trail, but it can't answer "what actually happened inside that command, step by step" — which specific files it read, what it inferred, what it proposed, what a consultant decided, why. Tracing exists for engagements that want that depth: a complete, structured, append-only record of every step of every command, scoped to the release and release type it ran under.

**Off by default.** Tracing never runs unless `WIRE_TRACE=true` is set in the shell environment. If it isn't, skip this entire section — do nothing, check nothing further, proceed straight to the Workflow Specification exactly as if this section didn't exist. This is the common case and must add zero overhead.

## Where it writes

`.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl` — one JSON object per line (JSON Lines), append-only, alongside that release's `status.md` and `execution_log.md`.

For commands not scoped to a specific release (cross-cutting utilities with `release_types: []` in their own front-matter, or any command whose argument isn't a release folder), write to `.wire/trace.jsonl` at the engagement level instead, with `release` and `release_type` fields set to `null`.

This file is **local only** — nothing in it is ever sent anywhere, unlike the anonymous Segment telemetry event described elsewhere. It stays on the consultant's machine, inside the engagement's own repo, exactly like `execution_log.md`.

## What to log, and when

If `WIRE_TRACE=true`:

1. **Resolve context once, before anything else**: the release folder (from this command's own argument, if it has one) and `release_type` (read `.wire/releases/<release_folder>/status.md`'s `project_type` or `release_type` field). If this command has no release-folder argument, both are `null`.
2. **Emit a `command_start` event** before beginning the Workflow Specification below.
3. **As you work through the Workflow Specification's own numbered steps, emit a `step` event after completing each one** — and where a step itself has meaningfully distinct numbered sub-parts (e.g. "check location A, then location B, then infer a match, then propose it"), treat each of those as its own step event too rather than collapsing them into one. The `detail` field has no length limit and is not a summary — write what actually happened: values found, files read, decisions made and why, what was proposed and what the consultant chose. If this step involved the data model registry or any other external/optional resource, log it explicitly: whether it was reached, what was searched, what matched (or didn't, and why not), and whether/how the result was used downstream.
4. **Emit a `command_end` event** when the workflow finishes, with the same `result` value this command would write to `execution_log.md` (`complete`, `pass`, `fail`, `approved`, etc.).

## How to emit an event

Use this pattern for every event (adjust the heredoc body and the Python literals per call — this is a template, not a fixed script):

```bash
[ "${WIRE_TRACE:-false}" = "true" ] && {
  mkdir -p ".wire/releases/<release_folder>" 2>/dev/null
  cat > "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt" << 'WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF'
<the full, untruncated detail text for this event — safe to include quotes,
newlines, code snippets, anything; this heredoc is not shell-interpreted>
WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF
  python3 -c "
import json, datetime
detail = open('/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt').read().rstrip('\n')
event = {
    'ts': datetime.datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'),
    'release': '<release_folder_or_null>',
    'release_type': '<release_type_or_null>',
    'command': 'region-tagging-generate',
    'event': '<command_start|step|command_end>',
    'step': '<step_number_or_null>',
    'step_name': '<step_heading_or_null>',
    'result': '<result_value_or_null>',
    'detail': detail,
}
with open('.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl', 'a') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(event) + chr(10))
"
  rm -f "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt"
}
```

- `<release_folder_or_null>` / `<release_type_or_null>`: from Step 1 above; write the literal JSON `null` (no quotes) if either doesn't apply, or a quoted string if it does.
- `event`: `command_start`, `step`, or `command_end`.
- `step` / `step_name`: `null` for `command_start`/`command_end`; the step's own number (e.g. `"1.5"`) and heading (e.g. `"Check for a Canonical Vertical Match"`) for a `step` event.
- `result`: `null` except on `command_end`.
- Adjust the file path in the final `open(...)` call to `.wire/trace.jsonl` for engagement-level (non-release-scoped) commands.

## Rules

1. **Never block or fail the workflow.** If a trace write fails for any reason (disk full, permissions), continue the workflow regardless — trace failures are never surfaced to the user and never stop anything.
2. **Append only** — never rewrite or delete existing lines in `trace.jsonl`.
3. **This is additive to `execution_log.md` and Telemetry, not a replacement for either.** All three continue exactly as documented elsewhere; tracing is a separate, optional, much finer-grained record for engagements that opt in.
4. **Don't summarize into brevity.** The entire point of this mechanism over `execution_log.md` is that it isn't limited to a 120-character line — write the real detail.

## Automatic Validation (on by default)

---
description: Internal utility — injected auto-validate section so generate commands run their matching validate step automatically and fold the result into their output
---

Every `generate` command that has a matching `validate` command for the
same artifact runs that validate step automatically as part of generate —
by default, with no separate command to remember. This section only appears
on commands where that applies; artifacts with no separate validate step at
all (e.g. mockups, workshops, UAT) never carry this section.

## Step: Check `auto_validate`

Read this command's own `auto_validate` front-matter field, in the Workflow
Specification below. Two states:

- **Absent, or `true`** (the default — most artifacts): auto-validate runs.
- **`false`**: this artifact's validate step is expensive — it runs real
  code, queries a live warehouse or BI tool, or otherwise does IO beyond
  re-reading local files — so it does not run automatically. Skip to
  "If `auto_validate: false`" below.

## If `auto_validate` is absent or `true`: run validate automatically

Once this command finishes writing its artifact, before ending:

1. Run this artifact's own `/wire:<artifact-with-dashes>-validate` workflow
   in full, exactly as if the consultant had typed it themselves — same
   inputs, same `status.md` write to `artifacts.<artifact>.validate`, same
   report. This is not optional or an extra step layered on top; it is the
   default behavior for this artifact.
2. Fold the result into this command's own closing output rather than
   presenting it as a separate command run:
   - **PASS** — add a single closing line: `✅ Auto-validated — PASS`. The
     full report already went to `status.md`/`execution_log.md`, exactly as
     it would from a standalone validate run — no need to repeat it here.
   - **FAIL** — surface the validate command's own failure report in full,
     exactly as running validate standalone would show it, so the
     consultant sees what's wrong immediately without running anything
     else themselves.
3. This never blocks or undoes generate itself — the artifact is written
   either way, and its content is never rolled back because validate
   failed. Auto-validation only means validate has already run and its
   result is already on record by the time generate finishes, instead of
   waiting for the consultant to remember to run it separately.

## If `auto_validate` is `false`: state this plainly, don't run it

Do not run validate. End with a line naming why, as specifically as this
spec's own context makes possible (e.g. "runs `dbt run`/`dbt test`",
"queries the live target warehouse", "calls the Looker API directly") —
fall back to "performs live checks against an external system" only if no
more specific reason is evident from context:

```
⚠ This artifact's validate step [reason] and does not run automatically.
Run /wire:<artifact-with-dashes>-validate <release_folder> before
requesting review — review is blocked until it passes.
```

## Why this is always safe either way

`review` already requires `validate: PASS` for this same artifact as one of
its own declared preconditions (see `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md`) —
this is existing, independent enforcement, not something added by this
section. So an `auto_validate: false` opt-out never lets an artifact reach
review unvalidated; it only decides *when* the consultant pays validate's
cost — automatically on every draft (the default), or once, on their own
schedule, before requesting review (the opt-out). Auto-validation is a
convenience that closes the "forgot to run it" gap for the common case; the
gate that actually prevents unvalidated work from being reviewed was already
there.

# Region Tagging — Generate

## Purpose

Reads the discovery audits and classifies every in-scope item into one of three region buckets for a tenant carve-out, emitting `region_tags.csv`. Each row carries the item id, its bucket, the signal that placed it there, and a confidence score.

**This command produces CANDIDATES, not decisions.** It is the first pass at "which of these items belong to the target region", and its only job is to sort items into a confident pile and an adjudication pile for a human to rule on at the review gate.

- It **never** emits a binary include/exclude flag.
- It **never** removes, excludes, or deletes any item.
- Every classification — including high-confidence ones — is a proposal carried into the human adjudication gate (`/wire:region-tagging-review`).

State this posture at the top of the generated artifact so no downstream reader treats the buckets as a scope decision.

This command runs only in **tenant carve-out** scope (`migration.scope == tenant_carveout`).

## Parameters

- `$ARGUMENTS` — the release folder.
- `--region <code>` — the target region to tag for. **Default: `de`.** Read it from `$ARGUMENTS`; if absent, use `de` and state the default in the output.

Example:
```
/wire:region-tagging-generate 01-migration --region de
```

## Prerequisites

- `migration.scope == tenant_carveout` in status.md
- The following discovery audits must have `review: approved`:
  - `dbt_audit`
  - `ingestion_audit`
  - `security_audit`
  - `db_object_audit`
  - `reverse_etl_audit` (the Hightouch sync inventory) — required when `migration.reverse_etl_tool` is set

If `scope` is not `tenant_carveout`, stop: "Region tagging runs in tenant carve-out scope only." If any required audit is not approved, list the pending audits and stop.

## Inputs

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/dbt_audit.csv` — model catalog (names, feature tags, refs)
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/reverse_etl_audit.md` — Hightouch sync inventory (sync names, destinations, warehouse objects)
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/ingestion_audit.md` — connectors and their landed schemas/destinations
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/security_audit.md` — roles/grants, tenant-scoped vs shared classification, tenant-key flags
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/db_object_audit.md` — tables/views catalog
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/status.md` — `migration.scope`, `migration.tenant_predicate`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Resolve the target region

Read `--region` from `$ARGUMENTS` (default `de`). Record the resolved region code and the `migration.tenant_predicate` — both are the reference signals for classification.

### Step 2: Load all in-scope items

Read each audit and assemble the full list of in-scope items, each tagged with its `source_audit` and `item_type` (`connector`, `table`, `view`, `dbt_model`, `role`, `reverse_etl_sync`, `reverse_etl_destination`, and — when a `metabase_audit` is approved — `metabase_card` and `metabase_dashboard`, #184). This union is the classification scope — every item is classified exactly once.

**Metabase item signals.** A card classifies by its collection/dashboard naming (a tenant-named collection is a confident-region signal), the tenant scope of the warehouse objects it reads (a card over only confident-region models inherits their confidence), and its audience (permission groups). A dashboard classifies with its card set. A card over shared-row-level models is itself `shared-row-level` — its tenant mechanism resolves at `metabase-carveout-generate` from the predicate registry, and the ruling on whether it belongs to the tenant at all is the adjudicator's, like every other shared item.

### Step 3: Classify each item into one of three buckets

For each item, look for region signals and assign the strongest-matching bucket:

- **confident-region** — an explicit, object-level signal ties the item to the target region:
  - **name suffix / token match** — the item name carries the region token (e.g. `_de`, `de_`, `..._de_...`) matching `--region`;
  - **destination match** — a Hightouch sync destination or ingestion connector schema is dedicated to the region;
  - **WHERE-clause match** — a dbt model or view filters on the market/tenant key in a way that matches `migration.tenant_predicate` (e.g. `WHERE country = 'DE'`).
  Record which of these signals fired.

- **shared-row-level** — the item serves multiple regions within the same object; the region distinction lives at the row level, not the object level. There is no object-level signal, but the item carries the tenant/market key. These need a **lineage trace plus row inspection** to decide how (or whether) to split — they cannot be ruled on from the name or destination alone.

- **global-deferred** — no market tag at all (global/reference/shared dimensions with no tenant key). The split is **deferred** — not decided in this pass.

A confident-region match wins over shared-row-level; shared-row-level wins over global-deferred. Record the single signal (or "none") that placed the item.

**Roles classify by grant scope (v3.11.1).** A role has no rows and no destination, so the three signals above only partially apply: the **name-suffix** signal applies to role names exactly as to any other name, but a role with no name signal classifies by the region status of the objects its grants reference (from the security audit's grant inventory), evaluated after all non-role items are classified:

- every object the role's grants reference is itself `confident-region` → **confident-region**, signal `grant-scope` (the role's whole access surface lives in the target region);
- the grants reference a mix of confident-region and other objects, or reference any `shared-row-level` object → **shared-row-level** (the role's surface spans regions; adjudication decides whether to split the role);
- the role has no object-level grants at all (account-level / administrative roles) → **global-deferred**.

Tests mirror this rule (`wire/tests/platform_migration/validate_region_tagging_classification.py`).

### Step 3b: Sibling-naming cross-check (v3.11.3)

Before scoring, catch the items whose ruling is already implied by a sibling group's. Group the classified items by name convention: strip a trailing version or variant token (`__v1`, `_v2`, `_new`, `_old`, `_deprecated`) and any region token, and treat the remainder as the family key. For each family where **some members are already ruled out of scope** — an `exclude` ruling in a prior wave's `region_tags_adjudicated.csv`, or an explicit exclusion recorded in the migration inventory — flag the unruled members with `sibling_exclusion_candidate: <the excluded sibling>` and carry them into the adjudication pile with that note.

This is a scope question, and it belongs here rather than three commands downstream. A model named for an already-excluded family (a re-platform variant, a deprecated parallel build) that is not flagged here falls through classification, through adjudication, and lands in `dbt-carveout-relocate-generate` as an injection failure — where it looks like a SQL-shape problem and is not one. Flagging it is all this step does: the ruling stays human, exactly as every other bucket's does.

### Step 4: Assign a confidence score

Give each row a confidence score in `[0.0, 1.0]`:
- confident-region with an explicit name/destination/WHERE signal → high (≥ 0.8)
- confident-region via the role `grant-scope` signal → medium-high (0.6–0.8) — derived from other items' classifications, so a notch below an explicit object-level signal
- shared-row-level → medium (≈ 0.4–0.7), reflecting that a human + lineage trace is still needed
- global-deferred → low / not-applicable (≤ 0.3)

The score reflects how strongly the signal supports the bucket, not a recommendation to include or exclude.

### Step 5: Emit region_tags.csv and the adjudication pile

**Output location**: `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/migration/region_tags.csv`

Columns:
```
item_id,item_type,source_audit,bucket,signal,confidence_score
```
One row per in-scope item, classified exactly once. `bucket` is one of `confident-region | shared-row-level | global-deferred`. No include/exclude or removal column — this artifact carries candidates only.

The **adjudication pile** is the subset a human must rule on: every `shared-row-level` row, plus any `confident-region` or `global-deferred` row below a confidence threshold (default `< 0.8`), plus every row Step 3b flagged `sibling_exclusion_candidate`. Carry it forward to the review gate.

### Step 5b: Seed the tenant predicate registry (v3.11.3)

**Output location**: `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/migration/tenant_predicate_registry.csv` (template `TEMPLATES/migration/tenant_predicate_registry.csv`)

Emit one registry row per classified item, following the seed table in `specs/utils/tenant_predicate_registry.md`: `confident-region` seeds `object_carve` (`resolved_by: object_signal`); `shared-row-level` seeds `row_predicate` with `migration.tenant_predicate` as the expression when the item carries the column that predicate filters on, and `unresolved` when it does not; `global-deferred` seeds `unresolved`.

Write the rows with a CSV writer under the write contract in `specs/utils/tenant_predicate_registry.md` (a field carrying a comma, quote, or newline is double-quoted, internal quotes doubled): a seeded expression with a comma in it must survive the write intact, and string concatenation truncates it at the first comma while keeping the column count valid (#200).

Determining whether an item carries the tenant column: for a dbt model, scan its compiled or source SQL **with SQL comments stripped first** (`/* ... */` and `-- ...` — a column name inside a comment is not a column reference, and treating one as a signal produces a confidently wrong seed); for a table or view, read the column list from the db-object audit.

The seed is a starting position. Nothing here is a decision, exactly as with the buckets: every `medium`/`low` row is already in the adjudication pile, and `region-tagging-review` is where a mechanism becomes a ruling (`resolved_by: adjudication`).

### Step 6: Write the summary

**Output location**: `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/migration/region_tagging.md`

Include:
- The CANDIDATES-not-decisions posture statement (from Purpose) at the top
- Target region and tenant predicate used
- Bucket counts: confident-region / shared-row-level / global-deferred
- The adjudication pile: items needing lineage + row inspection, with their signal and confidence
- A note that no item has been included, excluded, or removed — adjudication happens at `/wire:region-tagging-review`

### Step 7: Update status

```yaml
artifacts:
  region_tagging:
    generate: complete
    file: migration/region_tagging.md
    data_file: migration/region_tags.csv
    predicate_registry: migration/tenant_predicate_registry.csv
    generated_date: "{{TODAY}}"
    target_region: "{{REGION}}"
    items_classified: N
    confident_region: N
    shared_row_level: N
    global_deferred: N
    adjudication_pile: N
    sibling_exclusion_candidates: N
    registry_seeded: N
    registry_unresolved: N
```

### Step 8: Output summary

Print: target region, bucket counts, adjudication pile size, and next command:

```
/wire:region-tagging-validate $ARGUMENTS
```

## Output Files

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/migration/region_tags.csv`
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/migration/tenant_predicate_registry.csv`
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/migration/region_tagging.md`
- Updated `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/status.md`


## Post-Execution Hooks

After updating `status.md`, run these in sequence:

1. **Execution log** — Append one row to `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/execution_log.md` following `specs/utils/execution_log.md`.

2. **Jira sync** — Follow `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `region_tagging` as artifact, `generate` as action.

3. **Document store** — Follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `region_tagging` as artifact_id, `Region Tagging` as artifact_name, and the `file` value from `artifacts.region_tagging` in status.md as file_path.

4. **Auto-commit** — Follow `specs/utils/commit.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as release_folder, `region_tagging` as artifact, `generate` as action.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

---
description: Internal utility — appends a log entry to the project's execution log after any generate/validate/review workflow or skill activation
---

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Stale Status Check

Immediately after appending a **command** row (this does not apply to skill activation entries), perform a quick freshness check against the project's `status.md`. This is additive to the logging behavior above — it never blocks the calling command and never modifies `status.md`.

**Process**:
1. Derive `artifact_id` from the command just logged: strip the `/wire:` prefix and the trailing `-generate`, `-validate`, or `-review` suffix (e.g. `/wire:migration-inventory-generate` → `migration_inventory`). If the command doesn't map to a recognizable artifact (e.g. `/wire:new`, `/wire:status`, `/wire:archive`), skip this check entirely.
2. Read the artifact's own block in `status.md`: `artifacts.<artifact_id>`.
3. Check whether that artifact has already passed its review/approval gate — its `review` field (or equivalent approval field) shows `pass`, `approved`, or `complete`.
4. If the gate has passed, scan every field in the `artifacts.<artifact_id>` block for a value that is still the literal string `TBD`, or an empty list (`[]`) / `null` where the artifact's own template expects a populated value (i.e. the field is not legitimately optional).
5. For each stale field found, emit a one-line warning in the command's output:
   ```
   ⚠ status.md still shows `<field>: TBD` for `<artifact_id>` despite review: pass — status may be stale
   ```
   Emit one warning per stale field — do not suppress after the first.
6. After the last warning (only when at least one was emitted), add one closing line offering the repair path:
   ```
   Run /wire:status-sync <release-folder> to reconcile the record (see specs/utils/status_sync.md).
   ```
   The offer is informational only — never block the calling command and never run the sync automatically.
7. If no stale fields are found, the review/approval gate has not yet passed, or `artifact_id` could not be derived: no output, proceed silently.

This check is self-contained within this utility, so every caller gets it automatically without any caller-side changes.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
