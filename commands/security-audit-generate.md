# Security Audit — Generate

## Purpose

Catalogs all IAM roles, warehouse roles, users, groups, service accounts, row-level security policies, column masking policies, and network policies on the source platform. The output drives security configuration on the target platform and ensures no permission gaps during cutover.

## Prerequisites

- Release folder with `release_type: platform_migration` in `status.md`
- Sufficient privileges to query security catalog tables (ACCOUNTADMIN on Snowflake; Project IAM Viewer on BigQuery)

## Inputs

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/status.md` — source platform
- Source platform security/IAM APIs or `ACCOUNT_USAGE` / IAM metadata

## Workflow

### Step 1: Locate the release

Confirm `release_type: platform_migration`. Read `migration.source_platform`.

### Step 2: Query security catalog

**If source is BigQuery**:

Query IAM policy bindings:
```sql
-- Dataset-level IAM bindings
SELECT
  schema_name AS dataset,
  grantee,
  privilege_type,
  is_grantable
FROM `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMA_PRIVILEGES
ORDER BY schema_name, grantee;
```

Also collect:
- Project-level IAM bindings via `gcloud projects get-iam-policy` (if CLI available) or ask user to export
- Row-level security filters: `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ROW_ACCESS_POLICIES`
- Column-level security: `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMN_FIELD_PATHS` for policy tags
- Service accounts used by Fivetran and other integrations

**If source is Snowflake**:

```sql
-- All roles
SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.ROLES WHERE DELETED_ON IS NULL;

-- Role grants (role hierarchy)
SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.GRANTS_TO_ROLES
WHERE DELETED_ON IS NULL AND GRANTED_ON IN ('DATABASE','SCHEMA','TABLE','VIEW');

-- Users and their roles
SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.GRANTS_TO_USERS WHERE DELETED_ON IS NULL;

-- Row access policies
SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.ROW_ACCESS_POLICIES WHERE DELETED_ON IS NULL;

-- Dynamic data masking policies
SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.MASKING_POLICIES WHERE DELETED_ON IS NULL;

-- Network policies
SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.NETWORK_POLICIES;
```

### Step 3: Classify each security object

For each role / policy, classify:

- **Type**: `role`, `user`, `service_account`, `row_access_policy`, `column_mask`, `network_policy`
- **Migration approach**:
  - `recreate` — equivalent exists on target, can be recreated directly
  - `translate` — concept exists but syntax/mechanism differs (e.g., Snowflake role hierarchy → BigQuery IAM groups)
  - `evaluate` — no direct equivalent (e.g., BQ policy tags → Snowflake dynamic masking)
  - `exclude` — system roles, deprecated users

**Tenant carve-out (`migration.scope == tenant_carveout`)**

Read `migration.scope` and `migration.tenant_predicate` from status.md. When scope is `tenant_carveout`, additionally classify each role and grant by its tenant relationship:

- **tenant_scoped** — exists to give one tenant (or tenant group) access to its own data, or is gated on the tenant key. These map into the carve-out's tenant-scoped IAM model on the target.
- **shared** — platform-wide roles (admin, analyst, integration service accounts) that span all tenants. These are recreated on the target as-is, not narrowed to the extracted tenant.

Also flag, for every in-scope table, whether it carries the tenant key referenced by `migration.tenant_predicate` (e.g. `tenant_id`). Tables with the tenant key are candidates for a target row-level security policy on that key; tables without it are shared/reference data — note them so the strategy step can decide whether they are copied whole or excluded.

When scope is absent or `full_migration`, skip this classification entirely — the audit is unchanged.

### Step 4: Write the audit report

**Output location**: `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/security_audit.md`

Use the template at `TEMPLATES/migration/security_audit.md`. Include:
- Role hierarchy diagram (text-based tree)
- User and service account inventory
- Row-level security policies with SQL definitions
- Column masking policies with definitions
- Network policies
- Migration approach assignments
- Objects flagged `evaluate` with notes
- (tenant_carveout only) tenant_scoped vs shared classification for each role/grant, and the tenant-key presence flag per in-scope table

### Step 5: Update status

```yaml
artifacts:
  security_audit:
    generate: complete
    file: audit/security_audit.md
    generated_date: "{{TODAY}}"
    roles_count: N
    users_count: N
    rls_policies: N
    masking_policies: N
```

### Step 6: Output next command

```
/wire:security-audit-validate $ARGUMENTS
```

## Output Files

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/security_audit.md`
- Updated `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/status.md`


## Post-Execution Hooks

After updating `status.md`, run these in sequence:

1. **Execution log** — Append one row to `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/execution_log.md` following `specs/utils/execution_log.md`.

2. **Jira sync** — Follow `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `security_audit` as artifact, `generate` as action.

3. **Document store** — Follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `security_audit` as artifact_id, `Security Audit` as artifact_name, and the `file` value from `artifacts.security_audit` in status.md as file_path.

4. **Auto-commit** — Follow `specs/utils/commit.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as release_folder, `security_audit` as artifact, `generate` as action.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
