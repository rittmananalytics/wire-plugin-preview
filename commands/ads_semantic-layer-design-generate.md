# Design metric definitions and dimension model for semantic layer build

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command

# Agentic Data Stack — Semantic Layer Design Generate

Follow `specs/utils/semantic_layer_developer_delegate.md` before executing the workflow below.

## Purpose

Produce the complete metric and dimension specification for the semantic layer build — covering new metrics to add, existing metrics to rename or consolidate, and the dimension model that supports them. This document is the input to `semantic_layer-generate`.

## Usage

```bash
/wire:ads_semantic-layer-design-generate YYYYMMDD_client_agentic_data_stack
```

## Prerequisites

- `governance_design.review: approved`
- `metric_audit.review: approved`
- `query_audit.review: approved` (provides prioritised gap list)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read Inputs

1. `artifacts/governance_design.md` — canonical tables and their key fields
2. `artifacts/metric_audit_decisions.md` — conflict resolutions and agreed definitions
3. `artifacts/query_audit.md` — SL-gap and SL-extendable patterns, prioritised
4. Status.md `semantic_layer` field — which platform to target

### Step 2: Design First-Class Metrics

For each high-priority SL-gap and SL-extendable pattern from the query audit, design a metric definition. Use the canonical table fields from governance_design as the source.

For each metric, specify:

```yaml
# MetricFlow / dbt Semantic Layer format
metric:
  name: total_revenue
  description: "Net revenue (post-returns, post-tax) from confirmed orders"
  type: simple
  type_params:
    measure:
      name: net_amount
      agg: sum
      expr: net_amount
  filter: |
    {{ Dimension('order__status') }} = 'confirmed'
  label: "Total Revenue"
```

or for LookML:

```lookml
measure: total_revenue {
  type: sum
  sql: ${net_amount} ;;
  filters: [status: "confirmed"]
  description: "Net revenue post-returns and tax from confirmed orders"
  label: "Total Revenue"
  value_format_name: usd
}
```

### Step 3: Design Dimension Model

For each metric domain, specify the time and categorical dimensions needed:

```markdown
## Orders Domain — Dimension Model

**Entity:** order (primary key: order_id)

**Time dimensions:**
- order_date (DATE) — grain: day, week, month, quarter, year
- shipped_date (DATE) — grain: day, month

**Categorical dimensions:**
- channel (STRING) — acquisition channel
- status (STRING) — order status: pending, confirmed, cancelled, returned
- product_category (STRING) — join via dim_products
- customer_segment (STRING) — join via dim_customers
```

### Step 4: Identify Metric Dependencies

For complex metrics (ratios, running totals, period comparisons), document dependencies:

```markdown
## Derived Metrics

**conversion_rate:**
- Numerator: `orders_placed` (count distinct order_id WHERE status != 'cancelled')
- Denominator: `sessions` (from web_sessions domain — cross-domain join)
- Note: requires cross-domain join — verify MetricFlow / LookML join path

**revenue_vs_prior_period:**
- Base metric: `total_revenue`
- Comparison: prior period offset (30 days / same month prior year)
- Implementation: MetricFlow offset metric or LookML comparison period dimension
```

### Step 5: Write Semantic Layer Design Document

Write `.wire/<release-folder>/artifacts/semantic_layer_design.md` containing:
- Metric inventory by domain (new + modified)
- Dimension model per domain
- Derived metrics with dependency notes
- Implementation notes (MetricFlow YAML structure vs LookML measure format)
- Out-of-scope metrics (low-priority gaps deferred to future release)

### Step 6: Update Status

```yaml
semantic_layer_design:
  generate: complete
  generated_date: YYYY-MM-DD
  metrics_designed: N
  domains_covered: N
  platform: dbt_semantic_layer  # or lookml
```

## Output

- `.wire/<release-folder>/artifacts/semantic_layer_design.md`
- Updated `status.md`

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
