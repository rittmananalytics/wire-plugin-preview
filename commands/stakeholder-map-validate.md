# Validate stakeholder map completeness

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command

## Workflow Specification

# Stakeholder Map — Validate

## Purpose

Verifies that the stakeholder map covers every in-scope domain with at least one P0/P1 voice, and that every row has the fields needed to schedule and conduct the interview.

## Inputs

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/planning/stakeholder_map.md`
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/planning/engagement_brief.md` (to read the in-scope domain list)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Locate the map

Resolve `$ARGUMENTS`. Read both files. If the map is missing: "Run `/wire:stakeholder-map-generate $ARGUMENTS` first."

### Step 2: Run checks

#### Row-level completeness
For every row in the stakeholder table:
- [ ] Slug present and matches `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]+$` (kebab-case, ASCII)
- [ ] Name + title not empty
- [ ] Department populated
- [ ] Priority is one of `P0` / `P1` / `P2`
- [ ] Influence and interest are each one of `H` / `M` / `L`
- [ ] Sentiment is one of `Positive` / `Neutral` / `Sceptical` (no blanks for P0/P1 — guess if you must)
- [ ] Booking owner named
- [ ] Recommended interviewer named (an RA team member)
- [ ] Target week named (1 / 2 / 3)

#### Slug uniqueness
- [ ] Every slug appears at most once

#### Coverage
- [ ] Every in-scope domain from the engagement brief is covered by at least one P0 or P1
- [ ] Sponsor (from engagement brief) is in the table with priority `P0`
- [ ] At least one row has `Role in discovery: Sponsor`
- [ ] At least one row has `Role in discovery: SME` per in-scope domain
- [ ] At least one row references a technical / data owner

#### Volume sanity
- [ ] Total P0 + P1 count is in `[4, 12]` (single-domain) or `[6, 15]` (multi-domain). Flag a WARNING outside that range — too few risks under-coverage; too many risks discovery drift.

### Step 3: Produce report

**Output**: `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/planning/stakeholder_map_validation.md`

```markdown
# Stakeholder Map Validation Report

**Release**: $ARGUMENTS
**Date**: {{TODAY}}

## Result: PASS / FAIL / PASS WITH WARNINGS

## Checks

| Check | Result | Note |
|---|---|---|
| All rows complete | ✅ | |
| Slug format and uniqueness | ✅ | |
| In-scope domain coverage | ❌ | "Fulfilment" has no P0/P1 stakeholder |
| Sponsor present as P0 | ✅ | |
| Technical/data owner present | ✅ | |
| Volume sanity (P0+P1 count) | ⚠️ | 16 P0+P1 stakeholders for a single-domain discovery — risk of drift |

## Domain coverage

| Domain | P0 count | P1 count | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Retail | 2 | 3 | ✅ |
| Fulfilment | 0 | 0 | ❌ No coverage |
| Finance | 1 | 1 | ✅ |

## Issues to Resolve

### FAIL: Fulfilment domain has no stakeholder
Add at least one P0 or P1 from the fulfilment side. Without that voice, fulfilment requirements will be retrofitted from adjacent interviews.

### WARNING: P0+P1 count is high
16 P0+P1 interviews in a single-domain discovery will take 4+ weeks at 4–6 interviews/week. Either narrow the list, plan a longer Phase 2, or downgrade some to group P2 sessions.

## Next Steps

1. Resolve any FAILs
2. Confirm the map with the sponsor: /wire:stakeholder-map-review $ARGUMENTS
```

### Step 4: Update status

```yaml
artifacts:
  stakeholder_map:
    validate: complete   # or "failed"
```

### Step 5: Output summary

## Output Files

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/planning/stakeholder_map_validation.md`
- Updated `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/status.md`

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
