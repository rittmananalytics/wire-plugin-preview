# Reverse ETL Audit — Validate

## Purpose

Checks the reverse ETL audit for completeness and internal consistency. Confirms every sync has a migration approach, all warehouse dependencies are mapped, Lightning engine requirements are flagged, and the sync count matches the source data. Produces a PASS/FAIL report with specific gaps to address before review.

## Prerequisites

- `audit/reverse_etl_audit.md` exists (reverse_etl_audit generate: complete)

## Inputs

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/reverse_etl_audit.md`
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/status.md`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load the audit

Read `audit/reverse_etl_audit.md`. Confirm it is non-empty and contains the expected sections (Summary, Sync Catalog, Warehouse Dependency Map, Lightning Engine Syncs, Excluded Syncs).

### Step 2: Run validation checks

**Check 1 — All syncs have a migration approach**
Every row in the sync catalog has a value in the `migration_approach` column (repoint / rewrite_model / rebuild / decommission).
PASS: All rows populated.
FAIL: List syncs missing a migration approach.

**Check 2 — All syncs have a complexity rating**
Every row has a value in the `complexity` column (Low / Medium / High).
PASS: All rows populated.
FAIL: List syncs missing complexity.

**Check 3 — Source objects resolved across all model types, coverage reported**
Source-object resolution is attempted for every model type (`rawSql`, `dbtModel`, `table`, `custom`) — not just `rawSql`. Each sync with a resolvable source has at least one entry in `warehouse_objects`; each sync that genuinely could not be resolved is marked `source_resolved: false` and listed explicitly under "Unresolved syncs". The audit reports the source-resolution coverage metric (`resolved_sync_count` / `active_sync_count`), and status.md carries `resolved_sync_count`, `unresolved_sync_count`, and `source_resolution_coverage_pct`.
PASS: Resolution attempted for all model types, coverage metric present, and every unresolved sync is listed (none silently blank).
FAIL: `table`/`custom` syncs left blank without being listed as unresolved, or the coverage metric is missing.

**Check 4 — dbt model syncs cross-referenced**
Every sync with `model_type: dbtModel` has the dbt model name listed and a note confirming whether that model exists in the dbt audit (or noting it is out of scope).
PASS: All dbt model syncs have a cross-reference note.
FAIL: List dbt model syncs without cross-reference.

**Check 5 — Lightning engine syncs flagged**
If `lightning_sync_count` in status.md is > 0, the audit includes a Lightning Engine section listing the affected syncs and the two schema requirements.
PASS: Section present and populated, or lightning_sync_count = 0.
FAIL: Lightning syncs exist but section is missing or empty.

**Check 6 — Disabled/broken syncs have a decision**
If `data_source` in status.md is `hightouch_api` or `csv`: every sync with `status: disabled` or `status: interrupted` has either `migration_approach: decommission` with a reason, or `include_in_migration: true` with a note explaining why it will be migrated despite its current status.
PASS: All non-active syncs have a clear decision.
FAIL: List undecided non-active syncs.

If `data_source: git`: sync status is unavailable from Git files. Auto-pass this check and note in the validation report:
```
Check 6 skipped — audit sourced from Git files; runtime sync status not available.
Review sync decommission decisions manually with the client before proceeding to review.
```

**Check 7 — Sync count matches source**
The count of rows in the sync catalog matches `sync_count` in status.md.
PASS: Counts match.
FAIL: Report discrepancy.

**Check 8 — Row volume estimates present**
If `data_source` is `hightouch_api` or `csv`: at least 80% of active syncs have a non-null `last_run_rows`. Syncs with no run history should have a note.
PASS: ≥80% of active syncs have row volumes.
FAIL: Report percentage and list syncs missing estimates.

If `data_source: git`: row volumes are unavailable. Auto-pass this check and note in the validation report:
```
Check 8 skipped — audit sourced from Git files; runtime row volumes not available.
Row volume estimates are needed for cutover sequencing. Obtain these from the client
(Hightouch UI → sync run history) and add to the audit before migration inventory is drafted.
```

### Step 3: Write validation report

Append a `## Validation` section to `audit/reverse_etl_audit.md`:

```markdown
## Validation

**Run date**: {{TODAY}}
**Overall result**: PASS | FAIL

| Check | Result | Detail |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 1. Migration approaches complete | PASS/FAIL | ... |
| 2. Complexity ratings complete | PASS/FAIL | ... |
| 3. rawSql warehouse objects extracted | PASS/FAIL | ... |
| 4. dbt model syncs cross-referenced | PASS/FAIL | ... |
| 5. Lightning engine syncs flagged | PASS/FAIL | ... |
| 6. Non-active syncs have decisions | PASS/FAIL | ... |
| 7. Sync count matches source | PASS/FAIL | ... |
| 8. Row volume estimates present | PASS/FAIL | ... |

### Gaps to address
[List any FAIL items with specific syncs to fix]
```

### Step 4: Update status

```yaml
artifacts:
  reverse_etl_audit:
    validate: pass | fail
    validated_date: "{{TODAY}}"
```

### Step 5: Output next command

If PASS:
```
/wire:reverse-etl-audit-review $ARGUMENTS
```

If FAIL:
```
Validation failed. Address the gaps listed above, then re-run:
/wire:reverse-etl-audit-validate $ARGUMENTS
```


## Post-Execution Hooks

After updating `status.md`, run these in sequence:

1. **Execution log** — Append one row to `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/execution_log.md` following `specs/utils/execution_log.md`.

2. **Jira sync** — Follow `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `reverse_etl_audit` as artifact, `validate` as action.

3. **Document store** — Follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `reverse_etl_audit` as artifact_id, `Reverse ETL Audit` as artifact_name, and the `file` value from `artifacts.reverse_etl_audit` in status.md as file_path.

4. **Auto-commit** — Follow `specs/utils/commit.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as release_folder, `reverse_etl_audit` as artifact, `validate` as action.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
