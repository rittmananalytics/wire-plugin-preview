# Install Droughty, generate profile.yaml and droughty_project.yaml

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command

## Tracing (opt-in, off by default)

# Tracing — Detailed, Opt-In, Step-Level Execution Trace

## Purpose

`execution_log.md` records one terse row per whole command (timestamp, command, result, a detail string capped at 120 characters). That's enough for a normal audit trail, but it can't answer "what actually happened inside that command, step by step" — which specific files it read, what it inferred, what it proposed, what a consultant decided, why. Tracing exists for engagements that want that depth: a complete, structured, append-only record of every step of every command, scoped to the release and release type it ran under.

**Off by default.** Tracing never runs unless `WIRE_TRACE=true` is set in the shell environment. If it isn't, skip this entire section — do nothing, check nothing further, proceed straight to the Workflow Specification exactly as if this section didn't exist. This is the common case and must add zero overhead.

## Where it writes

`.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl` — one JSON object per line (JSON Lines), append-only, alongside that release's `status.md` and `execution_log.md`.

For commands not scoped to a specific release (cross-cutting utilities with `release_types: []` in their own front-matter, or any command whose argument isn't a release folder), write to `.wire/trace.jsonl` at the engagement level instead, with `release` and `release_type` fields set to `null`.

This file is **local only** — nothing in it is ever sent anywhere, unlike the anonymous Segment telemetry event described elsewhere. It stays on the consultant's machine, inside the engagement's own repo, exactly like `execution_log.md`.

## What to log, and when

If `WIRE_TRACE=true`:

1. **Resolve context once, before anything else**: the release folder (from this command's own argument, if it has one) and `release_type` (read `.wire/releases/<release_folder>/status.md`'s `project_type` or `release_type` field). If this command has no release-folder argument, both are `null`.
2. **Emit a `command_start` event** before beginning the Workflow Specification below.
3. **As you work through the Workflow Specification's own numbered steps, emit a `step` event after completing each one** — and where a step itself has meaningfully distinct numbered sub-parts (e.g. "check location A, then location B, then infer a match, then propose it"), treat each of those as its own step event too rather than collapsing them into one. The `detail` field has no length limit and is not a summary — write what actually happened: values found, files read, decisions made and why, what was proposed and what the consultant chose. If this step involved the data model registry or any other external/optional resource, log it explicitly: whether it was reached, what was searched, what matched (or didn't, and why not), and whether/how the result was used downstream.
4. **Emit a `command_end` event** when the workflow finishes, with the same `result` value this command would write to `execution_log.md` (`complete`, `pass`, `fail`, `approved`, etc.).

## How to emit an event

Use this pattern for every event (adjust the heredoc body and the Python literals per call — this is a template, not a fixed script):

```bash
[ "${WIRE_TRACE:-false}" = "true" ] && {
  mkdir -p ".wire/releases/<release_folder>" 2>/dev/null
  cat > "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt" << 'WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF'
<the full, untruncated detail text for this event — safe to include quotes,
newlines, code snippets, anything; this heredoc is not shell-interpreted>
WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF
  python3 -c "
import json, datetime
detail = open('/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt').read().rstrip('\n')
event = {
    'ts': datetime.datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'),
    'release': '<release_folder_or_null>',
    'release_type': '<release_type_or_null>',
    'command': 'droughty-setup',
    'event': '<command_start|step|command_end>',
    'step': '<step_number_or_null>',
    'step_name': '<step_heading_or_null>',
    'result': '<result_value_or_null>',
    'detail': detail,
}
with open('.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl', 'a') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(event) + chr(10))
"
  rm -f "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt"
}
```

- `<release_folder_or_null>` / `<release_type_or_null>`: from Step 1 above; write the literal JSON `null` (no quotes) if either doesn't apply, or a quoted string if it does.
- `event`: `command_start`, `step`, or `command_end`.
- `step` / `step_name`: `null` for `command_start`/`command_end`; the step's own number (e.g. `"1.5"`) and heading (e.g. `"Check for a Canonical Vertical Match"`) for a `step` event.
- `result`: `null` except on `command_end`.
- Adjust the file path in the final `open(...)` call to `.wire/trace.jsonl` for engagement-level (non-release-scoped) commands.

## Rules

1. **Never block or fail the workflow.** If a trace write fails for any reason (disk full, permissions), continue the workflow regardless — trace failures are never surfaced to the user and never stop anything.
2. **Append only** — never rewrite or delete existing lines in `trace.jsonl`.
3. **This is additive to `execution_log.md` and Telemetry, not a replacement for either.** All three continue exactly as documented elsewhere; tracing is a separate, optional, much finer-grained record for engagements that opt in.
4. **Don't summarize into brevity.** The entire point of this mechanism over `execution_log.md` is that it isn't limited to a 120-character line — write the real detail.

# Droughty Setup Command

## Purpose

One-time setup for Droughty in a Wire engagement. Installs the pinned Droughty version, generates `profile.yaml` from Wire context (deriving credentials from MCP config where available), generates `droughty_project.yaml` with output paths aligned to Wire's artifact structure, verifies warehouse connectivity, and records setup state in `status.md`.

Run this before any other `/wire:droughty-*` command.

## Usage

```bash
/wire:droughty-setup <release-folder>
```

Pass `--force` to re-run setup even if already complete (e.g. after a version refresh or credential change).

## Prerequisites

- `.wire/engagement/context.md` exists
- BigQuery Application Default Credentials configured (`gcloud auth application-default login`) **or** Snowflake credentials available
- Python >= 3.9, < 3.12.4 on PATH
- For `droughty docs` and `droughty qa`: an OpenAI API key

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read Wire Context

1. Read `.wire/engagement/context.md` — extract `client_name`, `engagement_name`
2. Read `.wire/releases/<release>/status.md` — check `droughty.setup.status`
3. If `droughty.setup.status == complete` and `--force` was not passed:
   ```
   Droughty is already configured for this release.
   Run with --force to overwrite the existing setup.
   ```
   Stop here.

### Step 2: Locate Pinned Version

1. Check for `wire/droughty/pinned_version.txt` in the repo root (dev mode)
2. If not found, check `~/.claude/plugins/wire/droughty/pinned_version.txt` (plugin mode)
3. If neither found, default to the latest published version and warn:
   ```
   ⚠️  pinned_version.txt not found — installing latest Droughty. Pin a version by creating wire/droughty/pinned_version.txt.
   ```

Read `PINNED_VERSION` from the file.

### Step 3: Install Droughty

Check if the correct version is already installed:
```bash
pip show droughty 2>/dev/null | grep "^Version:" | awk '{print $2}'
```

If not installed or wrong version:
```bash
pip install "droughty==[PINNED_VERSION]"
```

If the install fails, surface the error verbatim and stop. Common causes:
- Python version outside 3.9–3.12.3 range
- No internet access or pip not available

### Step 4: Determine Warehouse Type

Use `AskUserQuestion`:

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "Which warehouse should Droughty connect to?",
    "header": "Warehouse",
    "options": [
      {"label": "BigQuery", "description": "Google BigQuery — uses Application Default Credentials or a service account key"},
      {"label": "Snowflake", "description": "Snowflake — requires account ID, username, password, and warehouse name"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
}
```

Store `warehouse_type` as `bigquery` or `snowflake`.

### Step 5: Generate profile.yaml

Profile name: `[engagement_name]` (snake_case, from `context.md`).

Check whether `~/.droughty/profile.yaml` already exists with a profile of that name. If it does, ask:
```
A Droughty profile named '[engagement_name]' already exists. Overwrite it? (yes/no)
```

**For BigQuery:**

Check for existing ADC:
```bash
gcloud auth application-default print-access-token 2>/dev/null | head -c 10
```

If ADC is present, note it in the output. Ask directly in chat (one at a time):

1. "GCP project ID (e.g. `acme-analytics-prod`):"
2. "Default dataset name (e.g. `analytics`):"
3. "Which datasets/schemas should Droughty scan? List all that are in scope, comma-separated (e.g. `analytics,staging,raw`):"
4. "OpenAI API key? (required for `/wire:droughty-docs` and `/wire:droughty-qa` — press Enter to skip for now):"

Write `~/.droughty/profile.yaml` (append or create):

```yaml
[engagement_name]:
  type: bigquery
  project: [gcp_project_id]
  dataset: [dataset]
  schemas:
    - [schema1]
    - [schema2]
  openai_api_key: [openai_key]   # present only if provided
```

**For Snowflake:**

Ask directly in chat (one at a time):

1. "Snowflake account identifier (e.g. `xy12345.us-east-1`):"
2. "Username:"
3. "Password:"
4. "Virtual warehouse name (e.g. `COMPUTE_WH`):"
5. "Database name:"
6. "Default schema:"
7. "Role (e.g. `ANALYST` — press Enter to use default role):"
8. "Which schemas should Droughty scan? Comma-separated (e.g. `PUBLIC,STAGING`):"
9. "OpenAI API key? (required for `/wire:droughty-docs` and `/wire:droughty-qa` — press Enter to skip):"

Write `~/.droughty/profile.yaml`:

```yaml
[engagement_name]:
  type: snowflake
  account: [account_id]
  username: [username]
  password: [password]
  warehouse: [warehouse_name]
  database: [database]
  schema: [schema]
  role: [role]   # omit if not provided
  schemas:
    - [schema1]
    - [schema2]
  openai_api_key: [openai_key]   # present only if provided
```

### Step 6: Generate droughty_project.yaml

Ask in chat:

```
Where is your LookML project directory? (e.g. ./lookml — press Enter to skip if not using Looker)
```

```
Where is your dbt project directory? (default: ./ — press Enter for default)
```

Store `lookml_project_path` (or null) and `dbt_project_path`.

Create artifact directories:
```bash
mkdir -p .wire/releases/[release]/artifacts/droughty
mkdir -p .wire/releases/[release]/artifacts/droughty/field_descriptions
```

Write `droughty_project.yaml` at the git root:

```yaml
profile_name: [engagement_name]

# Output paths — Wire artifact structure
dbml_path: .wire/releases/[release]/artifacts/droughty/
field_description_path: .wire/releases/[release]/artifacts/droughty/field_descriptions/

# dbt output (if dbt project present)
dbt_path: [dbt_project_path]/models/
stage_path: [dbt_project_path]/models/staging/

# LookML output (if LookML project present)
# Droughty-generated base views land in views/generated/
# Wire-extended explores and refinements go in views/extended/
lookml_path: [lookml_project_path]/views/generated/
```

If `lookml_project_path` is null, omit the `lookml_path` line.

### Step 7: Verify Connectivity

Run a lightweight test to confirm warehouse access:

```bash
droughty dbml --profile-dir ~/.droughty --project-dir . 2>&1 | head -20
```

Interpret the result:
- If it produces output or a file, connectivity is confirmed. Extract table count from output if available.
- If it fails with an authentication error, surface the error and suggest credential fixes.
- If it connects but finds no tables, warn:
  ```
  ⚠️  Connected to [warehouse] but found no tables in: [schemas]

  If dbt models have not been deployed yet, run dbt first, then re-run this command.
  Check that the schemas listed in profile.yaml match what is in the warehouse.
  ```
  Do not treat this as a failure — setup is still complete.

### Step 8: Update status.md

Update in `.wire/releases/[release]/status.md`:

```yaml
droughty:
  setup:
    status: complete
    pinned_version: "[PINNED_VERSION]"
    warehouse: "[bigquery|snowflake]"
    profile_name: "[engagement_name]"
    schemas: [[list of schemas]]
    lookml_output_path: "[lookml_project_path]/views/generated/"   # or null
    dbt_project_path: "[dbt_project_path]"
    completed_date: "[today]"
```

### Step 9: Confirm and Guide Next Steps

```
## Droughty Setup Complete ✅

**Version**: [PINNED_VERSION]
**Warehouse**: [warehouse_type]
**Profile**: [engagement_name]
**Schemas in scope**: [comma-separated list]
**Artifact output**: .wire/releases/[release]/artifacts/droughty/

### Next Steps

Discovery commands (any warehouse, any time):

  /wire:droughty-introspect [release]   — Schema inventory report (tables, columns, PK/FK coverage)
  /wire:droughty-dbml [release]         — DBML entity-relationship diagram
  /wire:droughty-docs [release]         — AI-generated field descriptions
  /wire:droughty-qa [release]           — Data quality validation report

Post-dbt deploy commands (run after dbt models are deployed):

  /wire:droughty-dbt-tests [release]    — Pattern-based schema tests for deployed tables
  /wire:droughty-stage [release]        — Staging SQL + sources.yml (BigQuery)
  /wire:droughty-lookml [release]       — Base LookML views from dbt-created tables

Or run everything in sequence:
  /wire:droughty-generate [release]
```

## Refreshing the Pinned Version

Wire repo owners can update the pin to the latest published Droughty release with the bundled refresh script:

```bash
bash wire/droughty/refresh_version.sh
# or, to also commit the change automatically:
bash wire/droughty/refresh_version.sh --commit
```

The script queries PyPI, updates `wire/droughty/pinned_version.txt`, and prints the commit command. Once pushed, all subsequent `/wire:droughty-setup` runs install the new version.

Consultants on existing engagements should re-run `/wire:droughty-setup --force` after pulling the updated repo.

## Output

This command creates or updates:
- `~/.droughty/profile.yaml` (warehouse credentials — not committed to git)
- `droughty_project.yaml` at the git root
- `.wire/releases/[release]/artifacts/droughty/` artifact directory
- `droughty.setup` block in `.wire/releases/[release]/status.md`

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise

## Example

```markdown
