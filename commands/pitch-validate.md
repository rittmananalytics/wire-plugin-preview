# Validate pitch document structure and Shape Up quality

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command

## Workflow Specification

description: Validate pitch document structure, completeness, and Shape Up quality

# Pitch Validate Command

## Purpose

Validates that the pitch document is complete and meets the Shape Up quality bar — not too detailed (avoids over-specification), not too vague (enough to bet on). Checks all 10 sections, appetite specificity, solution sketch quality, and the "no premature solution" constraint.

## Inputs

**Required**:
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/planning/pitch.md`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read the Pitch

Resolve release folder. Read `planning/pitch.md`. If not found, prompt to generate first.

### Step 2: Run Validation Checks

#### Section completeness
- [ ] Section 1 (Problem) — present, summarises the problem for a decision-maker, references who has it
- [ ] Section 2 (Appetite) — explicitly states "Small batch" or "Big batch" with a time range; includes scope implications
- [ ] Section 3 (Solution Sketch) — present and non-empty; describes core user/system behaviour
- [ ] Section 4 (Rabbit Holes) — at least 1 rabbit hole named and described
- [ ] Section 5 (No-gos) — at least 2 no-gos listed
- [ ] Section 6 (Risks) — risk table has at least 1 row
- [ ] Section 7 (Success Criteria) — at least 2 measurable criteria listed as checkboxes
- [ ] Section 8 (Downstream Releases) — present (even if "TBD" or "none identified yet")
- [ ] Section 9 (Timeline) — all milestone dates present (or clearly marked TBD)
- [ ] Section 10 (The Bet) — non-empty, makes a case for doing this now

#### Quality checks
- [ ] **Appetite is specific**: Section 2 uses "Small batch (1–2 weeks)" or "Big batch (6 weeks)" — not vague phrases like "a few sprints"
- [ ] **Solution is shaped, not specified**: Section 3 describes behaviour without prescribing implementation choices (no specific database, no exact API design, no pixel-perfect UI)
- [ ] **Solution is not just restating the problem**: Section 3 proposes something, not just re-describes what's wrong
- [ ] **Success criteria are measurable**: Each criterion in Section 7 can be verified as true or false after delivery
- [ ] **No-gos are genuine boundaries**: Section 5 items would be tempting to add (otherwise they wouldn't need to be called out)
- [ ] **The Bet is persuasive**: Section 10 answers "why now" — not just "what"

#### Consistency checks
- [ ] **Appetite vs scope**: The solution in Section 3 is achievable within the stated appetite in Section 2
- [ ] **No-gos vs solution**: Nothing in the no-gos list contradicts the proposed solution
- [ ] **Success criteria vs problem**: Success criteria in Section 7 map back to the problem described in Section 1

### Step 3: Produce Validation Report

**Output location**: `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/planning/pitch_validation.md`

```markdown
# Pitch Validation Report

**Release**: [folder]
**Date**: [today's date]
**File**: planning/pitch.md

## Result: PASS / FAIL / PASS WITH WARNINGS

## Checks

| Check | Result | Note |
|-------|--------|------|
| Section 1: Problem summary | ✅ PASS | |
| Section 2: Appetite specific | ⚠️ WARNING | States "a few weeks" — must be "Small batch (1–2 weeks)" or "Big batch (6 weeks)" |
| Section 3: Solution sketched | ✅ PASS | |
| Section 4: Rabbit holes | ✅ PASS | |
| Section 5: No-gos | ✅ PASS | |
| Section 6: Risks | ✅ PASS | |
| Section 7: Measurable criteria | ❌ FAIL | Criterion 2 is not measurable: "users are happier" |
| Section 8: Downstream releases | ✅ PASS | |
| Section 9: Timeline | ✅ PASS | |
| Section 10: The Bet | ✅ PASS | |
| Appetite specificity | ⚠️ WARNING | |
| Solution shaped, not spec'd | ✅ PASS | |
| Appetite vs scope | ✅ PASS | |

## Issues to Resolve

### FAIL: Success criterion not measurable
Section 7 criterion 2: "users are happier" cannot be verified. Replace with a specific, observable outcome (e.g. "Operations team reports 0 overnight exception emails going unaddressed for 5 consecutive business days").

### WARNING: Appetite wording
Replace "a few weeks" in Section 2 with the standard Shape Up phrasing.

## Next Steps
[Pass/Fail next steps]
```

### Step 4: Update Release Status

```yaml
pitch:
  validate: "complete"  # or "failed"
```

## Output Files

- `.wire/releases/[folder]/planning/pitch_validation.md`
- Updated `.wire/releases/[folder]/status.md`

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
