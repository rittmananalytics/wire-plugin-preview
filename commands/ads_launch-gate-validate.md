# Agentic Data Stack — Launch Gate Validate

## Purpose

Final accuracy check before the agent is announced to the business. Only domains that meet their eval target are cleared. This is not a negotiation — if a domain is below target, it is not announced. Users who receive wrong answers lose trust that is very difficult to rebuild.

## Usage

```bash
/wire:ads_launch-gate-validate YYYYMMDD_client_agentic_data_stack
```

## Prerequisites

- `eval_suite.review: approved` (or `approved_with_conditions`)
- All domain fixes from eval_suite review have been applied and re-run

## Validation Steps

### Step 1: Re-run Full Eval Suite

Run the eval suite from scratch (not cached results):

```bash
cd <dbt_project_path> && ./.claude/eval/run_evals.sh all 2>&1 | tee eval_results_$(date +%Y%m%d).txt
```

### Step 2: Check Per-Domain Pass Rates

For each domain, compare current pass rate against `eval_targets.yaml` threshold.

### Step 3: Compile Launch Gate Report

```markdown
## Launch Gate Report

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Agent version:** [git SHA of agentic-data-stack-SKILL.md]

### Domain Status

| Domain | Pass Rate | Target | Status | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| orders | 94% | 90% | ✅ CLEARED | Announce |
| customers | 91% | 85% | ✅ CLEARED | Announce |
| marketing | 78% | 80% | ❌ BLOCKED | Fix active_customers_region gap first |
| finance | 88% | 90% | ❌ BLOCKED | 2 revenue reconciliation questions failing |

**Cleared for launch: 2/4 domains**  
**Blocked: 2/4 domains**

### Blocked Domain Issues

**marketing — 78% (target: 80%)**  
Failing questions:
- marketing_007: active customers by region — missing region dimension on active_customers metric
- marketing_012: campaign ROAS including affiliate channel — affiliate not in fct_ad_spend

Required actions:
1. Add region dimension to active_customers_30d semantic model
2. Confirm affiliate channel treatment with marketing team — may need separate metric

**finance — 88% (target: 90%)**  
...
```

### Step 4: Update Status

```yaml
launch_gate:
  validate: complete
  validate_date: YYYY-MM-DD
  domains_cleared: ["orders", "customers"]
  domains_blocked: ["marketing", "finance"]
  overall_pass_rate: X%
```

## What To Do With Blocked Domains

Blocked domains need targeted fixes — not a full re-do. Common fixes:
- Missing dimension on a metric → add to semantic model, re-run `ads_semantic-layer-generate`
- Deprecated table still being queried → update DOMAIN_REFERENCE.md, re-test
- Plausibility bounds too tight → adjust in adversarial_config.yaml, re-validate

After fixing, re-run `ads_eval-suite-validate` for the affected domain only, then re-run this launch gate.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
