# Metabase Migration — Validate

## Purpose

Checks the Metabase migration runbook for completeness: the client query inventory is present, every in-scope card has migration steps, `rewrite_sql` cards have verified SQL diffs, permission groups are remapped, validation runs on a decoy collection against a frozen baseline, and the two-stage connection repoint has per-stage rollback. Produces a PASS/FAIL report.

## Prerequisites

- `migration/metabase_migration_runbook.md` exists

## Validation Checks

**Check 1 — Client query inventory present**
The runbook records that it ran against a client-supplied query inventory (approved audit catalog or client export), not inferred SQL. `query_inventory_source` in status.md is set.
PASS: inventory source recorded. FAIL: no client inventory — the command must not have proceeded.

**Check 2 — Topology recorded**
The runbook states the additive topology (target BigQuery connection added alongside Snowflake, decoy collection for validation) with rationale, and documents the build steps.
PASS/FAIL.

**Check 3 — All in-scope cards covered**
Every card with `include_in_migration: true` in the inventory has a section in the runbook.
PASS: all present. FAIL: list missing cards.

**Check 4 — rewrite_sql cards have SQL diffs**
Every `rewrite_sql` card includes a before/after SQL diff (source dialect → BigQuery).
PASS: all diffs present. FAIL: list cards missing a diff.

**Check 5 — Translated SQL verified on target**
Each `rewrite_sql` card documents the result of running the translated SQL on the target BigQuery connection (row count, result shape) against the frozen baseline.
PASS/FAIL with unverified translations.

**Check 6 — Rebuild plans documented**
Every `rebuild` card has a documented rebuild plan against the target connection.
PASS/FAIL.

**Check 7 — Permission groups remapped**
The runbook includes a permission-group remap table mapping each group's source permissions to target BigQuery connection + collection permissions, with the before/after permission graph captured for rollback.
PASS/FAIL.

**Check 8 — Validation is decoy-based against a frozen baseline**
Validation compares card results against a frozen source baseline and runs on the decoy collection / non-production connection only. No production card or dashboard is repointed to validate.
PASS: decoy-based against a baseline. FAIL: validation repoints production cards, or compares against moving production.

**Check 9 — Two-stage cutover with per-stage rollback**
The cutover is two stages — pilot repoint, then full production connection repoint from Snowflake to BigQuery — and each stage has an explicit rollback (revert the database connection details; revert the permission graph; restore card SQL from diffs).
PASS: both stages and both rollbacks documented. FAIL: single-stage cutover, or a stage missing its rollback.

**Check 10 — Source connection left live until cutover**
The runbook does not repoint or delete the production Snowflake connection during the migration phase — only at cutover. The Snowflake connection remains the rollback path through Stage 2.
PASS: connection repoint appears only in the cutover section. FAIL: production connection repointed/deleted in migration or validation steps.

### Write validation report

Append a `## Validation` section to `migration/metabase_migration_runbook.md` with a per-check PASS/FAIL table and a "Gaps to address" list.

Update status:
```yaml
artifacts:
  metabase_migration:
    validate: pass | fail
    validated_date: "{{TODAY}}"
```

If PASS: `/wire:metabase-migration-review $ARGUMENTS`
If FAIL: fix gaps and re-run validate.


## Post-Execution Hooks

After updating `status.md`, run these in sequence:

1. **Execution log** — Append one row to `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/execution_log.md` following `specs/utils/execution_log.md`.

2. **Jira sync** — Follow `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `metabase_migration` as artifact, `validate` as action.

3. **Document store** — Follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `metabase_migration` as artifact_id, `Metabase Migration` as artifact_name, and the `file` value from `artifacts.metabase_migration` in status.md as file_path.

4. **Auto-commit** — Follow `specs/utils/commit.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as release_folder, `metabase_migration` as artifact, `validate` as action.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
