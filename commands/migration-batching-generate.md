# Migration Batching — Generate

## Purpose

Partitions the approved migration inventory into named **domain batches** — independently-implementable, schedulable slices of the migration scope, each spanning every layer it touches (ingestion, warehouse objects, dbt models, orchestration, reverse ETL) — and derives the dependency ordering between batches from the real dependency graph.

This replaces the hand-drafted batch spreadsheet. It is re-runnable whenever the inventory or dbt audit changes, specifically so a domain-batch plan cannot silently drift out of sync with the real dependency graph — a hand-drawn plan on a past engagement scheduled batches in parallel that the graph, once known, showed could not build in parallel, and nothing was responsible for catching it.

**Domain batches are not translation batches.** `dbt_audit.csv`'s `batch_number` is a translation batch — a group of ≤20 models sequenced for `/wire:dbt-migration-generate` runs. A domain batch is a business-scoped, multi-layer slice delivered as its own release or sprint. Do not conflate them.

**This command produces CANDIDATES, not decisions.** It proposes a partition and a dependency ordering. `/wire:migration-batching-review` is where a human/client adjusts and signs off on batch composition and schedule. Generate never marks a batch "approved" or "final", and never assigns a committed date or owner.

State this posture at the top of the generated artifact so no downstream reader treats the partition as a committed schedule.

## Prerequisites

- `migration/migration_inventory.md` with `review: approved`

If the inventory is not approved, stop: "Approve the migration inventory before batching — run /wire:migration-inventory-review $ARGUMENTS."

## Inputs

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/migration/migration_inventory.md` — unified object catalog, dependency graph, per-object effort-hour estimates
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/dbt_audit.csv` — per-model `batch_number`, `enabled`, `platform_macros`, layer/path (domain-grouping hints and the batch-zero dependency)
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/status.md`
- **Optional seed**: if `status.md` carries a `sow.batch_allocation` path (or a similar hand-drafted batch plan reference), or `--seed <path>` was passed in `$ARGUMENTS`, read the referenced CSV/plan of human-assigned batch names and groupings as a **seed, not ground truth** — it is reconciled against the real graph in Step 3, never accepted or discarded silently. If no seed exists, proceed with pure graph-derived grouping.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load the inventory graph and per-model detail

Parse the dependency graph from `migration_inventory.md` (adjacency list; the Mermaid diagram is a rendering, the adjacency list is the source) and the unified object catalog with per-object effort estimates. Parse `dbt_audit.csv` for per-model `batch_number`, `enabled`, and `platform_macros`.

### Step 2: Load the optional seed plan

If a seed exists (Step 0 of Inputs), extract its batch names and object→batch groupings. This is a starting hint for naming and grouping preference, to be reconciled against the graph in Step 3 — not accepted as-is. Record the seed path used, or "no seed provided".

### Step 3: Determine domain groupings

Assign every inventory object to exactly one candidate domain group:

- Where the seed plan assigns an object to a named domain group, start from that assignment.
- Where no seed exists, or for objects the seed doesn't cover, group by structural signal: schema/dataset name for db objects, top-level model folder or tag for dbt models, connector→destination pairing for ingestion and reverse ETL objects.
- **Merge rule**: merge two candidate groups if the edge density between them is high enough that separating them would force most objects in one group to declare a dependency on the other — they aren't really separable. State each merge and why in the narrative's seed-reconciliation note.

### Step 4: Build the batch-level dependency DAG

For every pair of domain groups with at least one graph edge crossing between them (from the inventory graph, dependency→dependent direction), record a directed batch-dependency edge from the prerequisite batch to the dependent batch.

If edges run in **both** directions between the same two groups, they are not actually separable — merge them into one batch rather than record a cyclic edge.

**The output DAG must be acyclic. This is a hard requirement — verify it before writing anything.** If a cycle survives the merge rule, keep merging along the cycle until it is gone, and record every merge in the narrative.

### Step 5: Fold in the batch-zero macro dependency

Any batch containing a model with a non-empty `platform_macros` value (from `dbt_audit.csv`) has an implicit prerequisite on the dbt-audit **batch-zero macro translation pass** (`audit/batch_zero_plan.json`) completing first. Record this explicitly per affected batch in the narrative's batch summary table and batch-zero callout — do not let it get lost among the domain-to-domain edges. This prerequisite lives in the narrative only; the CSV's `depends_on_batches` column carries domain batch ids, not the batch-zero pass.

### Step 6: Balance batch sizes

Using the inventory's per-object effort-hour estimates, aim for roughly even hours per batch — without breaking a domain grouping and without violating the Step 4 dependency order. Note any batch that is a clear size outlier and why. A shared foundational layer that many batches depend on is often small in object count but blocks everything — its position in the DAG matters more for scheduling than its own hours; say so in the narrative.

### Step 7: Identify parallel-safe batch groups

Any set of batches with **zero** dependency edges (either direction) between their members, per the Step 4 DAG, can be scheduled in parallel. Produce this list explicitly — it is the deliverable that directly answers "which of these batches can actually run at the same time", which is exactly what a hand-drawn plan gets wrong.

### Step 8: Emit the CSV

**Output location**: `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/migration/migration_batching.csv`

Columns:
```
object_id,object_type,source_audit,domain,batch_id,batch_name,depends_on_batches
```

One row per migration_inventory object, classified into exactly one batch. `batch_id` is zero-padded (`B01`, `B02`, …). `depends_on_batches` is a semicolon-separated list of `batch_id`s this object's batch depends on (may be empty; identical for every row in the same batch).

### Step 9: Emit the narrative

**Output location**: `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/migration/migration_batching.md`

Use the template at `TEMPLATES/migration/migration_batching.md`. Include:

- The CANDIDATES-not-decisions posture statement (from Purpose) at the top
- The seed-reconciliation note: what was kept from the seed, what changed and why (including every Step 3/4 merge), or "no seed provided"
- Batch summary table: `batch_id`, name, domain, object count, effort hours, `depends_on_batches`, batch-zero prerequisite (yes/no)
- A Mermaid DAG at batch granularity — nodes are batches, edges are dependencies
- The parallel-safe groupings table
- The batch-zero macro dependency callout: which batches require the batch-zero pass first, and why
- A note that this artifact is not authoritative for scheduling or dates until `/wire:migration-batching-review` runs

### Step 10: Update status

```yaml
artifacts:
  migration_batching:
    generate: complete
    file: migration/migration_batching.md
    data_file: migration/migration_batching.csv
    generated_date: "{{TODAY}}"
    batch_count: N
    objects_classified: N
    seed_used: true | false
```

### Step 11: Output summary

Print: batch count, object count, parallel-safe groupings found, and next command:

```
/wire:migration-batching-validate $ARGUMENTS
```

## Output Files

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/migration/migration_batching.csv`
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/migration/migration_batching.md`
- Updated `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/status.md`


## Post-Execution Hooks

After updating `status.md`, run these in sequence:

1. **Execution log** — Append one row to `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/execution_log.md` following `specs/utils/execution_log.md`.

2. **Jira sync** — Follow `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `migration_batching` as artifact, `generate` as action.

3. **Document store** — Follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `migration_batching` as artifact_id, `Migration Batching` as artifact_name, and the `file` value from `artifacts.migration_batching` in status.md as file_path.

4. **Auto-commit** — Follow `specs/utils/commit.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as release_folder, `migration_batching` as artifact, `generate` as action.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
