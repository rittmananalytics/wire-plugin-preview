# Pipeline Review Command

## Purpose

Present the configured pipeline connections for stakeholder review and approval. Routes to the tool-specific review spec for a connection-level summary, then gathers sign-off using the standard review pattern.

## Usage

```bash
/wire:pipeline-review YYYYMMDD_project_name
```

## Prerequisites

- `pipeline.validate == pass` in status.md

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read Status and Route

1. Read `.wire/<project_id>/status.md`
2. Check `artifacts.pipeline.validate`. If not `pass`:
   ```
   Warning: Pipeline has not passed validation yet.
   Run: /wire:pipeline-validate <project_id>
   Proceed anyway? (y/n)
   ```
3. Read `artifacts.pipeline.pipeline_tool`.

### Step 2: Delegate Summary to Tool-Specific Spec

Based on `pipeline_tool`, load and execute the corresponding review spec to build the review summary:

| `pipeline_tool` | Spec |
|----------------|------|
| `fivetran` | `wire/specs/development/pipeline/fivetran/review.md` |
| `dlt` | `wire/specs/development/pipeline/dlt/review.md` |
| `airbyte` | `wire/specs/development/pipeline/airbyte/review.md` |
| `custom` | Present the pipeline design document and connection configs directly |

### Step 3: Retrieve External Context (Optional)

1. Follow `specs/utils/meeting_context.md` — pass artifact name `pipeline`
2. Follow `specs/utils/atlassian_search.md` — pass artifact name `pipeline`
3. If a document store is configured, follow `specs/utils/docstore_fetch.md` — pass artifact `pipeline`

### Step 4: Gather Feedback

Use AskUserQuestion:

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "What is the review outcome?",
    "header": "Pipeline Review",
    "options": [
      {"label": "Approved", "description": "Pipeline connections are correctly configured and approved"},
      {"label": "Changes requested", "description": "Pipeline needs adjustments"},
      {"label": "Needs discussion", "description": "Requires further clarification"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
}
```

### Step 5a: If Approved

Ask: `Who approved the pipeline? (Name and role)`

Update status.md:
```yaml
pipeline:
  generate: complete
  validate: pass
  review: approved
  reviewed_by: "[Reviewer]"
  reviewed_date: <today>
```

Suggest next steps:
```
## Pipeline Approved

**Tool**: [pipeline_tool]
**Reviewed by**: [Reviewer]

### Next Steps

Generate the orchestration layer:
  /wire:orchestration-generate <project_id>
```

### Step 5b: If Changes Requested

Ask: `What changes are needed?`

Update status.md:
```yaml
pipeline:
  review: changes_requested
  feedback: "[Feedback]"
  reviewed_date: <today>
```

```
## Pipeline Changes Requested

### Change Requests:
[Feedback]

### Next Steps
1. Address feedback
2. Re-validate: /wire:pipeline-validate <project_id>
3. Re-submit: /wire:pipeline-review <project_id>
```

### Step 6: Sync to Jira (Optional)

Follow `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`:
- Artifact: `pipeline`
- Action: `review`
- Status: approved / changes_requested

### Step 7: Sync to Document Store (Optional)

If approved, follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md` to overwrite the document store page with the canonical file.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
