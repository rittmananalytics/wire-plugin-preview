# Generate data pipeline code

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command

## Auto-Delegation

Follow `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` before proceeding.

---

# Pipeline Generate Command

Follow `specs/utils/pipeline_engineer_delegate.md` before executing the workflow below.

## Purpose

Create and configure data pipeline connections based on the approved pipeline architecture. Routes to the appropriate tool-specific spec based on `pipeline_tool` recorded in `status.md` during pipeline design.

## Usage

```bash
/wire:pipeline-generate YYYYMMDD_project_name
```

## Prerequisites

- `pipeline_design`: `review: approved`
- `artifacts.pipeline.pipeline_tool` must be set in `status.md` (written by `/wire:pipeline_design-generate`)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read Status and Route

1. Read `.wire/<project_id>/status.md`
2. Verify `pipeline_design.review == approved`. If not:
   ```
   Error: Pipeline design must be approved before creating pipeline connections.
   Run: /wire:pipeline_design-review <project_id>
   ```
3. Read `artifacts.pipeline.pipeline_tool`. If null or absent:
   ```
   Error: No pipeline tool selected. Re-run pipeline design to choose a tool.
   Run: /wire:pipeline_design-generate <project_id>
   ```

### Step 2: Delegate to Tool-Specific Spec

Based on `pipeline_tool`, load and execute the corresponding spec in full:

| `pipeline_tool` | Spec |
|----------------|------|
| `fivetran` | `wire/specs/development/pipeline/fivetran/generate.md` |
| `dlt` | `wire/specs/development/pipeline/dlt/generate.md` |
| `airbyte` | `wire/specs/development/pipeline/airbyte/generate.md` |
| `custom` | Follow the bespoke approach documented in `.wire/<project_id>/design/pipeline_architecture.md` |

Pass `project_id` as context to the delegated spec.

### Step 3: Verify Output

After the tool-specific spec completes, confirm:
- A pipeline connections/config artifact exists under `.wire/<project_id>/development/pipeline/`
- `artifacts.pipeline.generate == complete` in status.md

If the tool-specific spec did not update status.md, update it now:
```yaml
pipeline:
  generate: complete
  validate: not_started
  review: not_started
  generated_date: <today>
```

### Step 4: Sync to Jira (Optional)

Follow the Jira sync workflow in `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`:
- Artifact: `pipeline`
- Action: `generate`
- Status: the generate state just written to status.md

### Step 5: Sync to Document Store (Optional)

If a document store is configured, follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`:
- `artifact_id`: `pipeline`
- `artifact_name`: `Data Pipeline`
- `file_path`: `.wire/<project_id>/development/pipeline/pipeline_connections.md`
- `project_id`: the project folder

### Step 6: Suggest Next Steps

```
## Pipeline Generated

**Tool**: [pipeline_tool]
**Artifact**: .wire/<project_id>/development/pipeline/pipeline_connections.md

### Next Steps

1. Validate the pipeline:
   /wire:pipeline-validate <project_id>
```

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
