# Execute and sign off logical-access UAT — the isolation-proof gate before cutover

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command

# Logical-Access UAT — Review

## Purpose

The sign-off gate where logical-access UAT is executed (or witnessed) and the evidence pack is completed. Approval is the written attestation that the tenant carve-out's access boundaries hold: users in the tenant's project reach only that project and see no other tenant's data. This gate sits before cutover — a failed or unsigned UAT blocks it.

## Prerequisites

- `migration/logical_access_uat_plan.md` with `validate: pass`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load meeting context

Follow `specs/utils/meeting_context.md` to surface any Fathom recordings touching data-residency, tenant isolation, or security sign-off requirements.

### Step 2: Execute the test matrix and capture evidence

Run each test (or witness the tester run it). For every test ID, fill the evidence block in the plan: actual result, evidence reference (query output, error text, masked value, or screenshot), PASS/FAIL, tester, date.

Pay special attention to the negative tests — each must produce a hard denial, zero cross-tenant rows, or a masked value. A negative test that returns another tenant's data is a **fail** and blocks sign-off regardless of how many positive tests pass.

### Step 3: Record outcomes and complete sign-off

Update the evidence blocks, then complete the sign-off block:

```markdown
## Sign-off
- All positive tests passed: ☑ / ☐
- At least one negative test passed per IAM boundary: ☑ / ☐
- No cross-tenant data was reachable in any negative test: ☑ / ☐

**Signed off by**: {{REVIEWER_NAME}}   **Role**: {{ROLE}}   **Date**: {{TODAY}}
**Decision**: approved | changes_requested
```

Approve only when all three attestations are checked. If any negative test failed, record `changes_requested`, note the boundary that leaked, and route back to `/wire:target-setup-generate` / `/wire:target-setup-review` to fix the IAM boundary before re-testing.

### Step 4: Update status

```yaml
artifacts:
  logical_access_uat:
    review: approved | changes_requested
    reviewed_by: "{{REVIEWER_NAME}}"
    reviewed_date: "{{TODAY}}"
```

### Step 5: Output next command

If approved:
```
/wire:cutover-generate $ARGUMENTS
```

## Review Gate

This review proves tenant isolation. Cutover must not proceed until logical-access UAT is `approved` with every negative test passing. Re-running the security DDL after sign-off invalidates the attestation and requires re-execution of the affected tests.


## Post-Execution Hooks

After updating `status.md`, run these in sequence:

1. **Execution log** — Append one row to `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/execution_log.md` following `specs/utils/execution_log.md`.

2. **Jira sync** — Follow `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `logical_access_uat` as artifact, `review` as action.

3. **Document store** — Follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `logical_access_uat` as artifact_id, `Logical-Access UAT` as artifact_name, and the `file` value from `artifacts.logical_access_uat` in status.md as file_path.

4. **Auto-commit** — Follow `specs/utils/commit.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as release_folder, `logical_access_uat` as artifact, `review` as action.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
