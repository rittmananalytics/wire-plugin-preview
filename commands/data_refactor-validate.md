# Data Refactor Validation Command

## Purpose

Validate that the refactored dbt project (transitioned from seed data to real client data) compiles correctly and runs successfully against the actual data sources.

## Usage

```bash
/wire:data_refactor-validate YYYYMMDD_project_name
```

## Prerequisites

- `data_refactor.generate` must be `complete` in status.md

## Workflow

### Step 1: Verify Prerequisites

**Process**:
1. Read `.wire/<project-folder>/status.md`
2. Verify `artifacts.data_refactor.generate` is `complete`

### Step 2: Compile Check

**Process**:
1. Navigate to the dbt project directory
2. Run `dbt compile` to verify all models parse correctly
3. Check for:
   - Missing source references (seeds that weren't properly replaced)
   - Undefined column references
   - SQL syntax errors from schema changes
   - Broken ref() chains

### Step 3: Run Models

**Process**:
1. Run `dbt run` to execute all models against real data
2. Track results per model:
   - Staging models: do they run without SQL errors?
   - Integration models: do joins work with real data?
   - Mart models: do aggregations produce results?
3. Note any failures with specific error messages

### Step 4: Run Tests

**Process**:
1. Run `dbt test` to execute all configured tests
2. Track results:
   - Schema tests (unique, not_null, accepted_values, relationships)
   - Custom data tests
3. Note test failures — some may be expected if real data has quality issues

### Step 5: Compare Outputs

**Process**:
1. Compare the refactored output against expected warehouse schema:
   - Read `design/target_warehouse_ddl.sql`
   - Verify all target tables were created
   - Verify column counts and types match expectations
2. Check row counts in mart tables (should be non-zero if data exists)

### Step 6: Generate Validation Report

**Process**:
Present validation results:

```
## Data Refactor Validation Report

**Project:** [project_name]
**Date:** [today's date]
**Result:** [PASS/FAIL]

### Compile Check
- Status: [PASS/FAIL]
- Models compiled: [count]
- Errors: [list if any]

### Model Execution
- Status: [PASS/FAIL]
- Models run: [count]
- Successful: [count]
- Failed: [count]
- Failures: [list with error details]

### Test Results
- Status: [PASS/FAIL]
- Tests run: [count]
- Passed: [count]
- Failed: [count]
- Failures: [list with details]

### Schema Comparison
- Target tables expected: [count]
- Target tables created: [count]
- Missing tables: [list if any]

### Summary
[Overall assessment — is the refactored project production-ready?]
```

### Step 7: Update Status

**Process**:
1. Read `status.md`
2. Update artifacts.data_refactor section:
   ```yaml
   data_refactor:
     generate: complete
     validate: pass  # or fail
     review: not_started
     validated_date: [today's date]
   ```
3. Write updated status.md

### Step 8: Sync to Jira (Optional)

Follow the Jira sync workflow in `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`:
- Artifact: `data_refactor`
- Action: `validate`
- Status: the validate state just written to status.md

### Step 9: Confirm and Suggest Next Steps

**If all checks pass**:
```
## Data Refactor Validation: PASS

The refactored project compiles and runs successfully against real data.

### Next Steps
1. **Review refactored project**: `/wire:data_refactor-review <project>`
```

**If checks fail**:
```
## Data Refactor Validation: FAIL

### Failures
[list failures]

### Recommended Action
Fix the issues identified above and re-run: `/wire:data_refactor-validate <project>`
If schema changes are needed, regenerate: `/wire:data_refactor-generate <project>`
```

## Edge Cases

### No Database Access

If real database is unavailable for testing:
- Run compile check only
- Note that runtime validation was skipped
- Set validate to `pass` with a note about compile-only validation

### Partial Failures

If some models succeed but others fail:
- Report which layers are working (staging OK, integration fails, etc.)
- Set validate to `fail` — all layers must pass for validation

## Output

This command outputs a validation report to the conversation and updates `status.md`. No files are created.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
