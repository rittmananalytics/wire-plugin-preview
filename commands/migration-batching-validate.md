# Validate domain batching — every object classified once, DAG acyclic, every real cross-batch edge declared

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command

# Migration Batching — Validate

## Purpose

Independently re-derives the ground truth for every check — the inventory object list, the object-level dependency graph, the macro flags — rather than trusting generate's self-report. This independence is the entire point: it is what catches a batch plan that has drifted out of sync with the real dependency graph.

## Validation Checks

Read `migration/migration_batching.csv`, `migration/migration_batching.md`, `migration/migration_inventory.md`, `audit/dbt_audit.csv`, and status.md.

**Check 1 — Every inventory object classified exactly once**
Rebuild the union of objects from `migration_inventory.md`'s unified catalog. Confirm a 1:1 match against `migration_batching.csv` rows — no object missing, none duplicated, no CSV row without a matching inventory object.
PASS: one-to-one match.
FAIL: list missing objects, duplicates, and orphan CSV rows, with counts of each.

**Check 2 — Batch dependency DAG is acyclic**
Rebuild the batch-level dependency graph from the CSV's `depends_on_batches` column alone. Confirm no cycles.
PASS: acyclic.
FAIL: list the cycle (the sequence of batch_ids).

**Check 3 — Every real cross-batch graph edge is declared**
Independently rebuild the object-level dependency graph from `migration_inventory.md`'s adjacency list plus `dbt_audit.csv`'s manifest-derived model dependencies. Do **not** read `migration_batching.md`'s own DAG as ground truth. For every graph edge whose two endpoints land in different batches (per the CSV's `batch_id` assignments), confirm the dependency direction is represented in `depends_on_batches` for the dependent batch. This is the check that directly answers "does this batch plan actually hold against the real dependencies."
PASS: every cross-batch edge declared.
FAIL: list every undeclared cross-batch edge — the two objects, their batches, and the correct direction.

**Check 4 — Batch-zero macro dependency present where required**
For every batch containing a model with a non-empty `platform_macros` value (re-read from `dbt_audit.csv`, not from generate's output), confirm the narrative declares the batch-zero macro translation pass as a prerequisite of that batch.
PASS: all affected batches declare it.
FAIL: list batches missing the prerequisite.

**Check 5 — Parallel-safe claims hold**
For every batch pair listed as parallel-safe in the narrative, confirm zero graph edges (either direction) between their member objects, per the Check 3 graph.
PASS: no parallel-safe claim contradicted.
FAIL: list each contradicted claim with the edge (objects, batches, direction) that breaks it.

**Check 6 — Every CSV row complete**
Each row has a non-empty `object_id`, `object_type`, `source_audit`, `domain`, `batch_id`, and `batch_name`. `depends_on_batches` may be empty.
PASS/FAIL with incomplete rows listed.

**Check 7 — Candidates only, no premature lock-in**
Neither `migration_batching.md` nor `status.md` marks any batch "approved" or "final", and no batch carries a committed date or owner — that is `/wire:migration-batching-review`'s job.
PASS: no lock-in language.
FAIL: quote the offending lines.

### Update status

```yaml
artifacts:
  migration_batching:
    validate: pass | fail
    validated_date: "{{TODAY}}"
```


## Post-Execution Hooks

After updating `status.md`, run these in sequence:

1. **Execution log** — Append one row to `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/execution_log.md` following `specs/utils/execution_log.md`.

2. **Jira sync** — Follow `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `migration_batching` as artifact, `validate` as action.

3. **Document store** — Follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `migration_batching` as artifact_id, `Migration Batching` as artifact_name, and the `file` value from `artifacts.migration_batching` in status.md as file_path.

4. **Auto-commit** — Follow `specs/utils/commit.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as release_folder, `migration_batching` as artifact, `validate` as action.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
