## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command
- `specs/<path>.md` references are shared workflow docs shipped with this plugin — read them from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/specs/<path>.md`. If the path matches a Wire command (e.g. `specs/requirements/generate.md`), it means that command (`/wire:requirements-generate`) and its spec is already embedded in the command file.

## Tracing (opt-in, off by default)

---
description: Internal utility — opt-in step-level execution tracing to .wire/releases/<release>/trace.jsonl when WIRE_TRACE=true
---

# Tracing — Detailed, Opt-In, Step-Level Execution Trace

## Purpose

`execution_log.md` records one terse row per whole command (timestamp, command, result, a detail string capped at 120 characters). That's enough for a normal audit trail, but it can't answer "what actually happened inside that command, step by step" — which specific files it read, what it inferred, what it proposed, what a consultant decided, why. Tracing exists for engagements that want that depth: a complete, structured, append-only record of every step of every command, scoped to the release and release type it ran under.

**Off by default.** Tracing never runs unless `WIRE_TRACE=true` is set in the shell environment. If it isn't, skip this entire section — do nothing, check nothing further, proceed straight to the Workflow Specification exactly as if this section didn't exist. This is the common case and must add zero overhead.

## Where it writes

`.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl` — one JSON object per line (JSON Lines), append-only, alongside that release's `status.md` and `execution_log.md`.

For commands not scoped to a specific release (cross-cutting utilities with `release_types: []` in their own front-matter, or any command whose argument isn't a release folder), write to `.wire/trace.jsonl` at the engagement level instead, with `release` and `release_type` fields set to `null`.

This file is **local only** — nothing in it is ever sent anywhere, unlike the anonymous Segment telemetry event described elsewhere. It stays on the consultant's machine, inside the engagement's own repo, exactly like `execution_log.md`.

## What to log, and when

If `WIRE_TRACE=true`:

1. **Resolve context once, before anything else**: the release folder (from this command's own argument, if it has one) and `release_type` (read `.wire/releases/<release_folder>/status.md`'s `project_type` or `release_type` field). If this command has no release-folder argument, both are `null`.
2. **Emit a `command_start` event** before beginning the Workflow Specification below.
3. **As you work through the Workflow Specification's own numbered steps, emit a `step` event after completing each one** — and where a step itself has meaningfully distinct numbered sub-parts (e.g. "check location A, then location B, then infer a match, then propose it"), treat each of those as its own step event too rather than collapsing them into one. The `detail` field has no length limit and is not a summary — write what actually happened: values found, files read, decisions made and why, what was proposed and what the consultant chose. If this step involved the data model registry or any other external/optional resource, log it explicitly: whether it was reached, what was searched, what matched (or didn't, and why not), and whether/how the result was used downstream.
4. **Emit a `command_end` event** when the workflow finishes, with the same `result` value this command would write to `execution_log.md` (`complete`, `pass`, `fail`, `approved`, etc.).

## How to emit an event

Use this pattern for every event (adjust the heredoc body and the Python literals per call — this is a template, not a fixed script):

```bash
[ "${WIRE_TRACE:-false}" = "true" ] && {
  mkdir -p ".wire/releases/<release_folder>" 2>/dev/null
  cat > "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt" << 'WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF'
<the full, untruncated detail text for this event — safe to include quotes,
newlines, code snippets, anything; this heredoc is not shell-interpreted>
WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF
  python3 -c "
import json, datetime
detail = open('/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt').read().rstrip('\n')
event = {
    'ts': datetime.datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'),
    'release': '<release_folder_or_null>',
    'release_type': '<release_type_or_null>',
    'command': 'dashboards-generate',
    'event': '<command_start|step|command_end>',
    'step': '<step_number_or_null>',
    'step_name': '<step_heading_or_null>',
    'result': '<result_value_or_null>',
    'detail': detail,
}
with open('.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl', 'a') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(event) + chr(10))
"
  rm -f "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt"
}
```

- `<release_folder_or_null>` / `<release_type_or_null>`: from Step 1 above; write the literal JSON `null` (no quotes) if either doesn't apply, or a quoted string if it does.
- `event`: `command_start`, `step`, or `command_end`.
- `step` / `step_name`: `null` for `command_start`/`command_end`; the step's own number (e.g. `"1.5"`) and heading (e.g. `"Check for a Canonical Vertical Match"`) for a `step` event.
- `result`: `null` except on `command_end`.
- Adjust the file path in the final `open(...)` call to `.wire/trace.jsonl` for engagement-level (non-release-scoped) commands.

## Rules

1. **Never block or fail the workflow.** If a trace write fails for any reason (disk full, permissions), continue the workflow regardless — trace failures are never surfaced to the user and never stop anything.
2. **Append only** — never rewrite or delete existing lines in `trace.jsonl`.
3. **This is additive to `execution_log.md` and Telemetry, not a replacement for either.** All three continue exactly as documented elsewhere; tracing is a separate, optional, much finer-grained record for engagements that opt in.
4. **Don't summarize into brevity.** The entire point of this mechanism over `execution_log.md` is that it isn't limited to a 120-character line — write the real detail.

## Automatic Validation (on by default)

---
description: Internal utility — injected auto-validate section so generate commands run their matching validate step automatically and fold the result into their output
---

Every `generate` command that has a matching `validate` command for the
same artifact runs that validate step automatically as part of generate —
by default, with no separate command to remember. This section only appears
on commands where that applies; artifacts with no separate validate step at
all (e.g. mockups, workshops, UAT) never carry this section.

## Step: Check `auto_validate`

Read this command's own `auto_validate` front-matter field, in the Workflow
Specification below. Two states:

- **Absent, or `true`** (the default — most artifacts): auto-validate runs.
- **`false`**: this artifact's validate step is expensive — it runs real
  code, queries a live warehouse or BI tool, or otherwise does IO beyond
  re-reading local files — so it does not run automatically. Skip to
  "If `auto_validate: false`" below.

## If `auto_validate` is absent or `true`: run validate automatically

Once this command finishes writing its artifact, before ending:

1. Run this artifact's own `/wire:<artifact-with-dashes>-validate` workflow
   in full, exactly as if the consultant had typed it themselves — same
   inputs, same `status.md` write to `artifacts.<artifact>.validate`, same
   report. This is not optional or an extra step layered on top; it is the
   default behavior for this artifact.
2. Fold the result into this command's own closing output rather than
   presenting it as a separate command run:
   - **PASS** — add a single closing line: `✅ Auto-validated — PASS`. The
     full report already went to `status.md`/`execution_log.md`, exactly as
     it would from a standalone validate run — no need to repeat it here.
   - **FAIL** — surface the validate command's own failure report in full,
     exactly as running validate standalone would show it, so the
     consultant sees what's wrong immediately without running anything
     else themselves.
3. This never blocks or undoes generate itself — the artifact is written
   either way, and its content is never rolled back because validate
   failed. Auto-validation only means validate has already run and its
   result is already on record by the time generate finishes, instead of
   waiting for the consultant to remember to run it separately.

## If `auto_validate` is `false`: state this plainly, don't run it

Do not run validate. End with a line naming why, as specifically as this
spec's own context makes possible (e.g. "runs `dbt run`/`dbt test`",
"queries the live target warehouse", "calls the Looker API directly") —
fall back to "performs live checks against an external system" only if no
more specific reason is evident from context:

```
⚠ This artifact's validate step [reason] and does not run automatically.
Run /wire:<artifact-with-dashes>-validate <release_folder> before
requesting review — review is blocked until it passes.
```

## Why this is always safe either way

`review` already requires `validate: PASS` for this same artifact as one of
its own declared preconditions (see `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md`) —
this is existing, independent enforcement, not something added by this
section. So an `auto_validate: false` opt-out never lets an artifact reach
review unvalidated; it only decides *when* the consultant pays validate's
cost — automatically on every draft (the default), or once, on their own
schedule, before requesting review (the opt-out). Auto-validation is a
convenience that closes the "forgot to run it" gap for the common case; the
gate that actually prevents unvalidated work from being reviewed was already
there.

# dashboards Generate Command

Follow `specs/utils/semantic_layer_developer_delegate.md` before executing the workflow below.

## Purpose

Generate dashboards based on requirements and design specifications.

## Usage

```bash
/wire:dashboards-generate YYYYMMDD_project_name
```

## Prerequisites

Enforced by the precondition gate (`preconditions: dynamic` — see
`wire/release-types/<project_type>.yaml`), release-type dependent:

- **`full_platform`**: `semantic_layer`: `validate: PASS`. Dashboards here sit
  on top of the deployed semantic layer.
- **`dashboard_first`**: `seed_data`: `review: approved`. Dashboards here are
  built against seed data before the real dbt project exists — see
  `data_refactor` for the later swap to live data.

## Inputs

| Input | Where it comes from | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `design/dashboard_visualization_catalog.csv` | `mockups-generate` Step 4A | `dashboard_first`, `dashboard_extension` |
| `design/dashboard_spec.md` | `mockups-generate` Step 4A | `dashboard_first`, `dashboard_extension` |
| `design/mockups/*.html` | `mockups-generate` Step 3A | `dashboard_first`, `dashboard_extension` |
| `design/visualization_catalog.md` | `viz_catalog-generate` | `dashboard_first` |
| the semantic layer files | `semantic_layer-generate` | `full_platform`, `dbt_development` |
| `bi_tool`, `semantic_layer_project`, `semantic_layer_model` | `status.md` frontmatter | always |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Resolve the target and the tile source

Read `status.md`. Establish four things and **stop rather than guess any of them**:

1. **`project_type`** — decides which tile source applies (Step 2).
2. **`bi_tool`** — `looker` (default), `omni`, `oac`, `metabase`, `cube`. Routes Step 4.
3. **The semantic layer target** — the project, model and explore (or the equivalent in the
   BI tool) the dashboard is built on. Read from `status.md`
   (`semantic_layer_project`, `semantic_layer_model`, `semantic_layer_explore`) where present,
   otherwise from the approved `semantic_layer` artifact, otherwise **ask**.
4. **The output path** — the BI project directory the files belong in. Read from
   `status.md` (`bi_project_path`) or the approved deployment guide, otherwise **ask**.

If any of 3 or 4 cannot be resolved, stop:

```
Cannot generate dashboards without a semantic layer target and an output path.

Resolved so far:
  bi_tool:                  [value or MISSING]
  semantic_layer_project:   [value or MISSING]
  semantic_layer_model:     [value or MISSING]
  semantic_layer_explore:   [value or MISSING]
  bi_project_path:          [value or MISSING]

Set the missing values in status.md and re-run, or supply them now.
```

A dashboard written against a guessed model or into a guessed directory has to be found and
deleted by hand, which costs more than asking.

### Step 2: Resolve the tile list

The tile list is read, never invented. Where it comes from depends on `project_type`:

| `project_type` | Tile source | If absent |
|---|---|---|
| `dashboard_first`, `dashboard_extension` | `design/dashboard_visualization_catalog.csv`, one tile per row | stop, and name `mockups-generate` as the command that writes it |
| `full_platform`, `dbt_development`, `pipeline_only`, `enablement` | the dashboards section of `requirements/requirements_specification.md`, plus the approved `semantic_layer` field list | stop, and name the missing artifact |

Parse the catalog into one record per tile: `dashboard_page`, `visualization_name`,
`chart_type`, `measures`, `dimensions`. Column names vary slightly between runs, so match on
substring (`page`, `visualization`, `chart`/`type`, `measure`, `dimension`) exactly as
`viz_catalog-generate` Step 2 does.

**Every catalog row becomes exactly one tile.** A row you cannot map is reported, never dropped
silently. See Step 3.

### Step 3: Map each catalog row to a visualization type

`chart_type` in the catalog is mockup vocabulary. It has to be translated to the BI tool's
vocabulary. The mapping is fixed, so that two people generating from the same catalog produce
the same dashboard:

| Catalog `chart_type` | Looker `type` | Omni / OAC / Metabase equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| `KPI tile`, `KPI`, `single value`, `stat` | `single_value` | single value / scalar |
| `line`, `area`, `spline` | `looker_line` | line |
| `bar`, `column`, `vertical bar` | `looker_column` | column |
| `horizontal bar`, `hbar` | `looker_bar` | bar |
| `doughnut`, `donut`, `pie` | `looker_pie` | pie |
| `table`, `grid`, `data table` | `looker_grid` | table |
| `scatter` | `looker_scatter` | scatter |
| `map`, `geo` | `looker_map` | map |
| `funnel` | `looker_funnel` | funnel |
| `text`, `markdown`, `note` | `text` | text |

Matching is case-insensitive and ignores surrounding whitespace and hyphens.

**An unrecognised `chart_type` is not a guess.** Record the tile with
`type: looker_grid` (a table shows the underlying values without reshaping them), and add the row to
an `unmapped_tiles` list carried into Step 6 and the output summary. A table showing the right
numbers is recoverable; a silently-chosen chart type that misrepresents them is not.

### Step 4: Generate the dashboard files

One file per dashboard page in the catalog. Follow the BI tool's own conventions, which the
relevant skill defines: `looker-dashboard-mockup` and `lookml-content-authoring` for Looker,
`omni` for Omni, `dbt-to-smml` and `smml-semantic-modeling` for OAC, `metabase` for Metabase,
`cube` for Cube.

For **Looker**, write LookML dashboard files to
`<bi_project_path>/dashboards/<page-slug>.dashboard.lookml`:

- `layout: newspaper`, 24 columns.
- Preserve the mockup's tile order. KPI tiles first, then chart rows, then tables, matching the
  mockup's reading order rather than the catalog's row order where the two differ.
- Every tile carries `model`, `explore`, `type`, `fields`, and a `listen` block mapping each
  dashboard filter to the field it filters.
- Reference each measure and dimension by its **semantic layer field name**
  (`<view>.<field>`), resolved against the approved semantic layer. A field the semantic layer
  does not define is an unresolved tile, reported per Step 6, never invented as LookML.
- Filters come from the `dashboard_spec.md` "Filter Dimensions" section. Each becomes a
  `field_filter` with the default value the spec records.
- Carry the mockup's series colours where the catalog or spec records them, so the delivered
  dashboard matches the artifact the stakeholder approved.
- Add a comment on each tile naming the catalog row it came from, so the mapping is auditable
  after the fact.

### Step 5: Cross-check the dashboard against the approved mockup

Before writing status, compare what you generated against the mockup that was signed off:

| Check | Rule |
|---|---|
| Tile count | one generated tile per catalog row, no more and no fewer |
| Tile titles | match the catalog's `visualization_name` |
| Filters | every filter in `dashboard_spec.md` is present on the dashboard |
| Fields | every measure and dimension resolves to a real semantic layer field |

Differences are recorded, not silently accepted. A dashboard that renders but shows nine of
eleven approved tiles has failed at the thing the release type exists to protect.

### Step 6: Update Status

**Process**:
1. Read `status.md`
2. Update artifacts.dashboards section:
   ```yaml
   dashboards:
     generate: complete
     validate: not_started
     review: not_started
     generated_date: "{{TODAY}}"
     bi_tool: looker | omni | oac | metabase | cube
     semantic_layer_model: "<model>"
     semantic_layer_explore: "<explore>"
     dashboard_files: []            # one path per generated dashboard page
     tiles_generated: N
     catalog_rows: N                # must equal tiles_generated
     unmapped_tiles: N              # chart_type not in the Step 3 table, rendered as a table
     unresolved_fields: N           # measures/dimensions with no semantic layer field
   ```

`tiles_generated` and `catalog_rows` are both recorded so a mismatch is visible in the status
file itself, not only in this run's console output.
3. Write updated status.md

### Step 7: Sync to Jira (Optional)

Follow the Jira sync workflow in `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`:
- Artifact: `dashboards`
- Action: `generate`
- Status: the generate state just written to status.md

### Step 8: Sync to Document Store (Optional)

If a document store is configured for this project, follow the workflow in `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`:
- `artifact_id`: `dashboards`
- `artifact_name`: `Dashboards`
- `file_path`: `.wire/releases/[release_folder]/dev/dashboards.md`
- `project_id`: the release folder path

If docstore sync fails, log the error and continue — do not block the generate command.

### Step 9: Confirm and Suggest Next Steps

**Output**:
```
## Dashboards Generated

**BI tool:**   [bi_tool]
**Model:**     [semantic_layer_model] · explore [semantic_layer_explore]
**Files:**     [one path per dashboard page]

### Coverage
Catalog rows:        N
Tiles generated:     N
Unmapped chart type: N   [list each: row name, the chart_type given]
Unresolved fields:   N   [list each: tile name, the field that does not exist]

### Mockup cross-check (Step 5)
[PASS, or one line per difference between the dashboard and the approved mockup]

### Next Steps

1. **Validate**: /wire:dashboards-validate <release>
2. Open the dashboard in [bi_tool] and confirm it renders against real data
3. **Review with stakeholders**: /wire:dashboards-review <release>
```

Any non-zero `unmapped_tiles` or `unresolved_fields` count is stated here and again in status.
A dashboard is not finished while either is above zero, and `dashboards-validate` fails on both.

## Edge Cases

### Semantic layer target or output path cannot be resolved

Step 1 stops rather than guessing. See the message there.

### A catalog row's chart_type is not in the Step 3 table

The tile renders as `looker_grid` and the row is reported in `unmapped_tiles`. The dashboard is
generated, and `dashboards-validate` Check 2 fails while any unmapped tile remains, so the
fallback cannot become the delivered dashboard by default.

### A measure or dimension does not exist in the semantic layer

The tile is recorded in `unresolved_fields` and is not written with an invented field name.
`dashboards-validate` Check 3 fails while any remains.

### The catalog is missing on a dashboard-first release

Stop and name `mockups-generate` as the command that writes it. Do not fall back to
`requirements_specification.md` on a release type whose tile source is the catalog: that
substitutes a different, unapproved tile list for the one the stakeholder signed off.

### Prerequisites not met

The precondition gate blocks first (`preconditions: dynamic`), naming the artifact and action
that is outstanding for this release type.

## Output

This command creates:
- One dashboard file per catalog dashboard page, at the resolved `bi_project_path`
  (for Looker: `<bi_project_path>/dashboards/<page-slug>.dashboard.lookml`)
- Updates `status.md` `artifacts.dashboards` with the file list, tile counts, and the
  `unmapped_tiles` / `unresolved_fields` counts
- Appends one row to `execution_log.md`

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

---
description: Internal utility — appends a log entry to the project's execution log after any generate/validate/review workflow or skill activation
---

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Stale Status Check

Immediately after appending a **command** row (this does not apply to skill activation entries), perform a quick freshness check against the project's `status.md`. This is additive to the logging behavior above — it never blocks the calling command and never modifies `status.md`.

**Process**:
1. Derive `artifact_id` from the command just logged: strip the `/wire:` prefix and the trailing `-generate`, `-validate`, or `-review` suffix (e.g. `/wire:migration-inventory-generate` → `migration_inventory`). If the command doesn't map to a recognizable artifact (e.g. `/wire:new`, `/wire:status`, `/wire:archive`), skip this check entirely.
2. Read the artifact's own block in `status.md`: `artifacts.<artifact_id>`.
3. Check whether that artifact has already passed its review/approval gate — its `review` field (or equivalent approval field) shows `pass`, `approved`, or `complete`.
4. If the gate has passed, scan every field in the `artifacts.<artifact_id>` block for a value that is still the literal string `TBD`, or an empty list (`[]`) / `null` where the artifact's own template expects a populated value (i.e. the field is not legitimately optional).
5. For each stale field found, emit a one-line warning in the command's output:
   ```
   ⚠ status.md still shows `<field>: TBD` for `<artifact_id>` despite review: pass — status may be stale
   ```
   Emit one warning per stale field — do not suppress after the first.
6. After the last warning (only when at least one was emitted), add one closing line offering the repair path:
   ```
   Run /wire:status-sync <release-folder> to reconcile the record (see specs/utils/status_sync.md).
   ```
   The offer is informational only — never block the calling command and never run the sync automatically.
7. If no stale fields are found, the review/approval gate has not yet passed, or `artifact_id` could not be derived: no output, proceed silently.

This check is self-contained within this utility, so every caller gets it automatically without any caller-side changes.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
