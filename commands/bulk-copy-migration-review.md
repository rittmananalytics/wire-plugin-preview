# Safety-gated approval before the first tenant bulk-copy execution

## User Input

```text

```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository

# Bulk Copy Migration — Review

## Purpose

Safety-gated review before any data is copied from Snowflake to BigQuery. Approval authorises the migration team to execute the **first copy** — the Stage 1 pilot partition. This is the point at which a misconfigured copy could touch the wrong tenant's data, so it requires explicit written approval.

## Prerequisites

- `migration/bulk_copy_migration_runbook.md` with `validate: pass`
- `migration.scope == tenant_carveout`

## SAFETY GATE

```
⚠️  SAFETY GATE — First Tenant Bulk-Copy Execution

Approving this review authorises the migration team to execute the Stage 1
pilot-partition copy from Snowflake to BigQuery for ONE tenant.

  - Source (Snowflake) stays READ ONLY and live — no decommission yet
  - Every extract is filtered by migration.tenant_predicate: [tenant_predicate]
  - Writes land only in: [migration.target_project] / [dataset]
  - The copy runs under a scoped service account, not an admin credential
  - Stage 2 (remainder) runs only after the equivalency gate passes

Please confirm ALL of:
[ ] I have reviewed the bulk copy runbook
[ ] migration.tenant_predicate is correct and scopes exactly the intended tenant
[ ] The scoped service account is in place and has access ONLY to the target
    tenant's project/dataset (and dedicated staging bucket, GCS-staged path)
[ ] The destination is the designated target project — NOT a production project
[ ] Target schemas exist and have been verified
[ ] The two-stage gate is understood: pilot partition → equivalency checks 1 and 6
    → remainder, with Stage 2 blocked until the gate passes
[ ] The source remains live; decommission is deferred to cutover
```

Wait for explicit confirmation of all items. If any box is unchecked, stop:

```
Safety gate not cleared. Address the unchecked items and re-run:
/wire:bulk-copy-migration-review $ARGUMENTS
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Present runbook summary

Display: copy mechanism (BQ Data Transfer Service / GCS-staged), tables in scope, tenant predicate, scoped service account identity, target destination, and the pilot-partition chosen for Stage 1.

### Step 2: Safety gate confirmation

Present the checklist. Wait for confirmation of every item.

### Step 3: Record decision

Append a review block to the runbook recording the decision, the reviewer, and the date, with the safety-gate confirmation:

```markdown
## Review

**Reviewed by**: {{REVIEWER_NAME}}
**Review date**: {{TODAY}}
**Decision**: approved | changes_requested

### Safety gate confirmation
All checklist items confirmed by: {{REVIEWER_NAME}}
First copy execution authorised: Stage 1 pilot partition only.
```

### Step 4: Update status

```yaml
artifacts:
  bulk_copy_migration:
    review: approved | changes_requested
    reviewed_by: "{{REVIEWER_NAME}}"
    reviewed_date: "{{TODAY}}"
```

### Step 5: Output next command

If approved, run the equivalency gate after the pilot partition copy, then continue to the dbt migration:
```
/wire:equivalency-validate $ARGUMENTS
/wire:dbt-migration-generate $ARGUMENTS
```


## Post-Execution Hooks

After updating `status.md`, run these in sequence:

1. **Execution log** — Append one row to `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/execution_log.md` following `specs/utils/execution_log.md`.

2. **Jira sync** — Follow `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `bulk_copy_migration` as artifact, `review` as action.

3. **Document store** — Follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `bulk_copy_migration` as artifact_id, `Bulk Copy Migration` as artifact_name, and the `file` value from `artifacts.bulk_copy_migration` in status.md as file_path.

4. **Auto-commit** — Follow `specs/utils/commit.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as release_folder, `bulk_copy_migration` as artifact, `review` as action.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
