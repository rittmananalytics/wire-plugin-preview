# Review conceptual model with business stakeholders

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command

# Conceptual Model Review Command

## Purpose

Present the conceptual entity model to business stakeholders for approval. This is a **business-level review, not a technical review**. The goal is to confirm:
- The right entities are included and named in the client's own terminology
- No important entities are missing
- Relationships correctly reflect how the business works
- The model aligns with the SOW scope

**Review audience**: Business stakeholders, client subject matter experts, and the project sponsor — not solely the technical team. The pipeline architecture, data model specification, and all dbt code that follow will be constrained by what is approved here. Getting this right now prevents expensive rework later.

## Usage

```bash
/wire:conceptual_model-review YYYYMMDD_project_name
```

## Prerequisites

- `conceptual_model`: `validate: pass`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Verify Prerequisites

Check `conceptual_model.validate == pass` in `status.md`.

If validation has not passed:
```
Error: Conceptual model must pass validation before stakeholder review.
Run: /wire:conceptual_model-validate <project_id>
```

If there are unresolved Open Questions (Section 5 of conceptual_model.md is non-empty), flag this to the consultant:
```
Warning: [N] open questions remain in the conceptual model (Section 5).
These should be resolved in the review session or in a workshop before approval.
```

### Step 2: Present the Conceptual Model

Display `design/conceptual_model.md` in full, including:
- Entity inventory (Section 1)
- erDiagram (Section 2)
- Relationship narrative (Section 3)
- Out-of-scope entities (Section 4)
- **Open questions (Section 5) — highlight prominently**

Suggest the consultant shares this document with stakeholders directly (e.g. in a screen-share, printed, or via a shared link) rather than reading it aloud.

### Step 2.5: Retrieve External Context (Optional)

**Process**:
1. Follow the meeting context retrieval workflow defined in `specs/utils/meeting_context.md`
   - Pass the project folder and artifact name `conceptual_model`
   - If Fathom MCP is available and relevant meetings found, present the meeting context summary
2. Follow the Atlassian search workflow defined in `specs/utils/atlassian_search.md`
   - Pass the project folder and artifact name `conceptual_model`
   - If Atlassian MCP is available, search Confluence for design docs and Jira for issue comments
   - Present any relevant findings
3. If a document store is configured, follow `specs/utils/docstore_fetch.md`:
   - Pass `artifact_id`, `artifact_name`, `file_path`, and `project_id` for this artifact
   - This retrieves any reviewer comments added to the document store page since generation, and flags any edits made directly to the document store version vs the canonical GitHub version
   - Surface the returned "Document Store Context" block to the reviewer alongside Fathom and Confluence context
4. If neither service is available, proceed directly to Step 3

This step enriches the review with context from meeting recordings, Confluence documents, and Jira issue comments.

### Step 3: Gather Feedback

Use AskUserQuestion to collect the review outcome:

**Question**: "Has the conceptual model been reviewed with business stakeholders? What is the outcome?"

**Options**:
1. **Approved** — All entities and relationships are correct and complete. No open questions remain. Proceed to pipeline design and data model specification.
2. **Changes requested** — Entities or relationships need updating. Capture the specific changes needed.
3. **Needs discussion** — Further clarification required before approval (open questions unresolved, or significant disagreement on scope).

If "Changes requested": prompt "Please describe the required changes (which entities to add/remove/rename, which relationships to correct):" and capture as notes.

If "Needs discussion": suggest running a workshop.
```
Suggested next step: generate workshop materials to facilitate the discussion.
/wire:workshops-generate <project_id>
```

### Step 4: Update Status

**If approved**:
```yaml
conceptual_model:
  review: approved
  reviewed_by: [name and/or role of approver]
  reviewed_date: [today]
```
Add to status notes: `"Conceptual model approved [date] by [reviewer] — [entity count] entities, [relationship count] relationships confirmed"`

**If changes requested**:
```yaml
conceptual_model:
  review: changes_requested
  reviewed_date: [today]
```
Add to status notes: `"Conceptual model: changes requested [date] — [one-line summary of changes needed]"`

**If needs discussion**:
```yaml
conceptual_model:
  review: pending
```
Add to status blockers: `"Conceptual model review pending — open questions require workshop resolution"`

### Step 5: Suggest Next Steps

**If approved**:
```
## Conceptual Model Approved ✅

The entity model is confirmed by business stakeholders. Downstream design
artifacts are now unblocked.

### Next Steps (can be run in parallel or either order)

Design the data pipeline architecture:
  /wire:pipeline_design-generate <project_id>

Begin the data model specification (dbt layers):
  /wire:data_model-generate <project_id>

Both commands will read the approved conceptual model as a primary input.
```

**If changes requested**:
```
## Changes Required

Update design/conceptual_model.md with the requested changes:
[list changes captured]

Then re-validate and re-review:
  /wire:conceptual_model-validate <project_id>
  /wire:conceptual_model-review <project_id>
```

### Step 6: Sync to Jira (Optional)

Follow the Jira sync workflow in `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`:
- Artifact: `conceptual_model`
- Action: `review`
- Status: the review state just written to status.md (approved/changes_requested/pending)
- If approved, include reviewer name in Jira comment
- If changes_requested, include feedback text in Jira comment

### Step 7: Sync to Document Store (Optional)

If a document store is configured and the review outcome is **Approved**, follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md` to overwrite the document store page with the canonical file. This ensures the document store reflects the approved version.

- If the outcome is Changes Requested or Needs Discussion, do not overwrite — the document store retains the reviewed version for reference until the next generate run.

## Edge Cases

### Stakeholder Not Available for Synchronous Review

If the review must be conducted asynchronously (e.g. by email or shared document):
- Record the date the document was sent and expected response date
- Set status to `pending` with a note
- Add to blockers: `"Conceptual model review pending stakeholder response — sent [date]"`

### Partial Approval (Some Entities Agreed, Others Disputed)

If stakeholders approve some entities but dispute others:
- Do not record as fully approved
- Record as `changes_requested`
- Note specifically which entities/relationships are agreed vs disputed
- Only disputed items need rework — don't regenerate the whole document

### Significant Scope Change Revealed During Review

If the review surfaces a major scope change (e.g. an entirely new domain added, or a core entity removed):
- Record as `changes_requested`
- Note: a significant scope change may also require updating the requirements specification
- Check whether the SOW needs to be amended before proceeding

## Output

- Updates `.wire/<project_id>/status.md` with review outcome, reviewer name, and date
- Notes added to status.md recording the decision and any change requests

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
