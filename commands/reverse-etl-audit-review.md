# Reverse ETL Audit — Review

## Purpose

Internal RA review of the reverse ETL audit before it feeds into the migration inventory. The reviewer confirms sync coverage, agrees on decommission decisions, validates that warehouse dependency mapping is complete, and flags any syncs that need deeper investigation before the migration strategy is drafted — particularly any Customer Studio audiences or Journeys that require rebuild.

## Prerequisites

- `audit/reverse_etl_audit.md` exists with `validate: pass`

## Inputs

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/reverse_etl_audit.md`
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/status.md`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load meeting context

Follow `specs/utils/meeting_context.md` to retrieve any Fathom recordings relevant to this release. Search for discussions about data activation, downstream destinations, Hightouch syncs, or reverse ETL. Surface relevant extracts — particularly any mentions of specific destination tools, sync frequency requirements, or known sync failures.

### Step 2: Present audit for review

Display a summary of the reverse ETL audit:
- Total syncs, broken down by destination type
- Migration approach distribution (repoint / rewrite_model / rebuild / decommission)
- Complexity breakdown (Low / Medium / High)
- Lightning engine syncs requiring schema recreation
- dbt model syncs and their migration batch dependencies
- Syncs flagged for decommission with reasons
- Any syncs with `status: interrupted` or `status: pending`

### Step 3: Gather reviewer feedback

Ask the reviewer:

1. Is the sync list complete — are there any syncs or workspace environments not captured here?
2. Do the decommission decisions look right? Any syncs that should be kept or cut differently?
3. Are there any High-complexity syncs (Customer Studio audiences, Journeys, or rewrite_model cases) that need a spike before migration strategy is drafted?
4. Are the warehouse object dependencies correct — do the listed tables/views match what the team knows about these syncs?
5. Any concerns about sync volume, schedule frequency, or destination credentials that will affect cutover timing?

### Step 4: Apply feedback and record decision

Incorporate any corrections into `audit/reverse_etl_audit.md`. Record the review outcome:

```markdown
## Review

**Reviewed by**: {{REVIEWER_NAME}}
**Review date**: {{TODAY}}
**Decision**: approved | changes_requested

### Reviewer notes
[Capture any comments, corrections, or follow-up actions]
```

### Step 5: Update status

```yaml
artifacts:
  reverse_etl_audit:
    review: approved | changes_requested
    reviewed_by: "{{REVIEWER_NAME}}"
    reviewed_date: "{{TODAY}}"
```

### Step 6: Output next command

If approved and all other audits are also approved:
```
/wire:migration-inventory-generate $ARGUMENTS
```

If other audits are still pending:
```
Continue with remaining audits. When all audits are approved:
/wire:migration-inventory-generate $ARGUMENTS
```

## Review Gate

The reverse ETL audit review is an internal RA gate — not a client deliverable at this stage. Approval confirms:
- All syncs are accounted for and decisions are defensible
- Warehouse dependency mapping is complete enough to drive cutover sequencing
- No blocking unknowns remain before migration strategy work begins

The output feeds directly into the migration inventory — specifically the dependency graph that determines which warehouse objects must be migrated before each sync can be re-pointed.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
