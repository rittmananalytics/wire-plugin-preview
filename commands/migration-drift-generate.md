# Scheduled drift gate — diff live source vs last-migrated commit, flag downstream syncs and masking changes

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command
- `specs/<path>.md` references are shared workflow docs shipped with this plugin — read them from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/specs/<path>.md`. If the path matches a Wire command (e.g. `specs/requirements/generate.md`), it means that command (`/wire:requirements-generate`) and its spec is already embedded in the command file.

## Tracing (opt-in, off by default)

description: Internal utility — opt-in step-level execution tracing to .wire/releases/<release>/trace.jsonl when WIRE_TRACE=true
---

# Tracing — Detailed, Opt-In, Step-Level Execution Trace

## Purpose

`execution_log.md` records one terse row per whole command (timestamp, command, result, a detail string capped at 120 characters). That's enough for a normal audit trail, but it can't answer "what actually happened inside that command, step by step" — which specific files it read, what it inferred, what it proposed, what a consultant decided, why. Tracing exists for engagements that want that depth: a complete, structured, append-only record of every step of every command, scoped to the release and release type it ran under.

**Off by default.** Tracing never runs unless `WIRE_TRACE=true` is set in the shell environment. If it isn't, skip this entire section — do nothing, check nothing further, proceed straight to the Workflow Specification exactly as if this section didn't exist. This is the common case and must add zero overhead.

## Where it writes

`.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl` — one JSON object per line (JSON Lines), append-only, alongside that release's `status.md` and `execution_log.md`.

For commands not scoped to a specific release (cross-cutting utilities with `release_types: []` in their own front-matter, or any command whose argument isn't a release folder), write to `.wire/trace.jsonl` at the engagement level instead, with `release` and `release_type` fields set to `null`.

This file is **local only** — nothing in it is ever sent anywhere, unlike the anonymous Segment telemetry event described elsewhere. It stays on the consultant's machine, inside the engagement's own repo, exactly like `execution_log.md`.

## What to log, and when

If `WIRE_TRACE=true`:

1. **Resolve context once, before anything else**: the release folder (from this command's own argument, if it has one) and `release_type` (read `.wire/releases/<release_folder>/status.md`'s `project_type` or `release_type` field). If this command has no release-folder argument, both are `null`.
2. **Emit a `command_start` event** before beginning the Workflow Specification below.
3. **As you work through the Workflow Specification's own numbered steps, emit a `step` event after completing each one** — and where a step itself has meaningfully distinct numbered sub-parts (e.g. "check location A, then location B, then infer a match, then propose it"), treat each of those as its own step event too rather than collapsing them into one. The `detail` field has no length limit and is not a summary — write what actually happened: values found, files read, decisions made and why, what was proposed and what the consultant chose. If this step involved the data model registry or any other external/optional resource, log it explicitly: whether it was reached, what was searched, what matched (or didn't, and why not), and whether/how the result was used downstream.
4. **Emit a `command_end` event** when the workflow finishes, with the same `result` value this command would write to `execution_log.md` (`complete`, `pass`, `fail`, `approved`, etc.).

## How to emit an event

Use this pattern for every event (adjust the heredoc body and the Python literals per call — this is a template, not a fixed script):

```bash
[ "${WIRE_TRACE:-false}" = "true" ] && {
  mkdir -p ".wire/releases/<release_folder>" 2>/dev/null
  cat > "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt" << 'WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF'
<the full, untruncated detail text for this event — safe to include quotes,
newlines, code snippets, anything; this heredoc is not shell-interpreted>
WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF
  python3 -c "
import json, datetime
detail = open('/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt').read().rstrip('\n')
event = {
    'ts': datetime.datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'),
    'release': '<release_folder_or_null>',
    'release_type': '<release_type_or_null>',
    'command': 'migration-drift-generate',
    'event': '<command_start|step|command_end>',
    'step': '<step_number_or_null>',
    'step_name': '<step_heading_or_null>',
    'result': '<result_value_or_null>',
    'detail': detail,
}
with open('.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl', 'a') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(event) + chr(10))
"
  rm -f "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt"
}
```

- `<release_folder_or_null>` / `<release_type_or_null>`: from Step 1 above; write the literal JSON `null` (no quotes) if either doesn't apply, or a quoted string if it does.
- `event`: `command_start`, `step`, or `command_end`.
- `step` / `step_name`: `null` for `command_start`/`command_end`; the step's own number (e.g. `"1.5"`) and heading (e.g. `"Check for a Canonical Vertical Match"`) for a `step` event.
- `result`: `null` except on `command_end`.
- Adjust the file path in the final `open(...)` call to `.wire/trace.jsonl` for engagement-level (non-release-scoped) commands.

## Rules

1. **Never block or fail the workflow.** If a trace write fails for any reason (disk full, permissions), continue the workflow regardless — trace failures are never surfaced to the user and never stop anything.
2. **Append only** — never rewrite or delete existing lines in `trace.jsonl`.
3. **This is additive to `execution_log.md` and Telemetry, not a replacement for either.** All three continue exactly as documented elsewhere; tracing is a separate, optional, much finer-grained record for engagements that opt in.
4. **Don't summarize into brevity.** The entire point of this mechanism over `execution_log.md` is that it isn't limited to a 120-character line — write the real detail.

## Automatic Validation (on by default)

---
description: Internal utility — injected auto-validate section so generate commands run their matching validate step automatically and fold the result into their output
---

Every `generate` command that has a matching `validate` command for the
same artifact runs that validate step automatically as part of generate —
by default, with no separate command to remember. This section only appears
on commands where that applies; artifacts with no separate validate step at
all (e.g. mockups, workshops, UAT) never carry this section.

## Step: Check `auto_validate`

Read this command's own `auto_validate` front-matter field, in the Workflow
Specification below. Two states:

- **Absent, or `true`** (the default — most artifacts): auto-validate runs.
- **`false`**: this artifact's validate step is expensive — it runs real
  code, queries a live warehouse or BI tool, or otherwise does IO beyond
  re-reading local files — so it does not run automatically. Skip to
  "If `auto_validate: false`" below.

## If `auto_validate` is absent or `true`: run validate automatically

Once this command finishes writing its artifact, before ending:

1. Run this artifact's own `/wire:<artifact-with-dashes>-validate` workflow
   in full, exactly as if the consultant had typed it themselves — same
   inputs, same `status.md` write to `artifacts.<artifact>.validate`, same
   report. This is not optional or an extra step layered on top; it is the
   default behavior for this artifact.
2. Fold the result into this command's own closing output rather than
   presenting it as a separate command run:
   - **PASS** — add a single closing line: `✅ Auto-validated — PASS`. The
     full report already went to `status.md`/`execution_log.md`, exactly as
     it would from a standalone validate run — no need to repeat it here.
   - **FAIL** — surface the validate command's own failure report in full,
     exactly as running validate standalone would show it, so the
     consultant sees what's wrong immediately without running anything
     else themselves.
3. This never blocks or undoes generate itself — the artifact is written
   either way, and its content is never rolled back because validate
   failed. Auto-validation only means validate has already run and its
   result is already on record by the time generate finishes, instead of
   waiting for the consultant to remember to run it separately.

## If `auto_validate` is `false`: state this plainly, don't run it

Do not run validate. End with a line naming why, as specifically as this
spec's own context makes possible (e.g. "runs `dbt run`/`dbt test`",
"queries the live target warehouse", "calls the Looker API directly") —
fall back to "performs live checks against an external system" only if no
more specific reason is evident from context:

```
⚠ This artifact's validate step [reason] and does not run automatically.
Run /wire:<artifact-with-dashes>-validate <release_folder> before
requesting review — review is blocked until it passes.
```

## Why this is always safe either way

`review` already requires `validate: PASS` for this same artifact as one of
its own declared preconditions (see `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md`) —
this is existing, independent enforcement, not something added by this
section. So an `auto_validate: false` opt-out never lets an artifact reach
review unvalidated; it only decides *when* the consultant pays validate's
cost — automatically on every draft (the default), or once, on their own
schedule, before requesting review (the opt-out). Auto-validation is a
convenience that closes the "forgot to run it" gap for the common case; the
gate that actually prevents unvalidated work from being reviewed was already
there.

# Migration Drift — Generate

## Purpose

A **scheduled drift gate**. During a long migration the source platform keeps changing — models are added, edited, and removed while batches are being translated and validated. This command diffs the **live** source dbt repo against the commit each model was last migrated from (recorded in the migration register), classifies what changed, updates register state, and surfaces the blast radius: which migrated models drifted, which downstream Hightouch syncs they feed, and whether a masking-policy change needs the policy tags regenerated.

It is designed to run on a schedule (see "Scheduling" below) and as a CI gate on the BigQuery project, so drift is caught the day it happens rather than during a cutover scramble.

## Prerequisites

- `migration/migration_register.csv` exists (`migration-register generate: complete`)
- `migration_sources.dbt` registered — the live source dbt repo
- A dbt binary available **only** for `dbt ls` state comparison (no warehouse connection needed for `ls`), or the manifest-diff fallback below

## Inputs

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/migration/migration_register.csv` — last-migrated commit per model
- `migration_sources.dbt` (live repo + local snapshot) — the current source state
- `audit/lineage/model_sync_map.json` (from `lineage-generate`) — Gold→Hightouch edges (which syncs read each warehouse model)
- `audit/reverse_etl_audit.md` — the Hightouch sync inventory and config references
- Source model `meta.masking_policy` declarations (schema/properties YAML)
- Translated model SQL under `migration/dbt/` — scanned for `-- MARKET GAP:` NULL-pad markers (Step 5b)
- Active platform pair `translation_guide.md` — the **"Deployment-integration / provenance defect patterns"** section (rule 4, `STALE_NULL_PAD_BRONZE_PRESENT`)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Refresh the live source

Run (or confirm a fresh) `/wire:migration-source-refresh $ARGUMENTS dbt` so the comparison is against the current source HEAD, not a stale snapshot. Record the live HEAD commit as `drift_head`.

### Step 2: Per-model state diff

For each `state = migrated` row in the register, compare its `last_migrated_commit` against `drift_head`. Use dbt's state comparison — **`dbt ls --select state:modified`** against a manifest built at `last_migrated_commit` as the `--state` baseline:

```
dbt ls --select state:modified --state <manifest@last_migrated_commit> --output name
```

`dbt ls` needs no warehouse connection. **Fallback (no dbt binary):** diff the model's `.sql` and its companion YAML between `last_migrated_commit` and `drift_head` with `git diff --name-status`, and parse `ref()`/`source()` + `{{ config() }}` to approximate modified/added/removed.

Classify each model:
- **modified** — the model (or its compiled definition / config / upstream refs) changed since `last_migrated_commit`. Set register `state = drifted`, record `drift_head` and a one-line change summary in `notes`.
- **removed** — the model no longer exists at `drift_head`. Set `state = removed`.
- **new** — a model present at `drift_head` with no register row. Add a row with `state = pending` (it needs migrating).
- **unchanged** — leave `state` as-is.

A model that drifted but whose `last_validated_commit` equals its old `last_migrated_commit` is flagged **"validated, now drifted"** — its prior equivalency pass is stale.

### Step 3: Flag downstream Hightouch syncs (Gold→Hightouch lineage)

For every model classified **modified** or **removed**, resolve its downstream Hightouch syncs from `model_sync_map.json` (emitted by `lineage-generate`). A re-migrated or removed Gold model flags every sync that reads it: those syncs must be re-validated (modified) or re-pointed/retired (removed). List each flagged sync with the model that triggered it.

### Step 4: Hightouch config diff

For each flagged sync, produce a **Hightouch config diff**: compare the sync's current config in the GitHub-Sync repo (model SQL, field mappings, filters) against what `reverse-etl-migration` translated, and show what the upstream drift implies — e.g. a renamed/removed column the sync's model SQL still references. This tells the reverse-ETL owner exactly what to re-translate, rather than just "something upstream changed."

### Step 5: Masking-change hook

For each **modified** model, diff its source `meta.masking_policy` (in the model's schema/properties YAML) between `last_migrated_commit` and `drift_head`. If `meta.masking_policy` was **added, changed, or removed** on any column, flag a **masking change** and trigger the policy-tag generator: re-run the `target-setup` security step (`04_security.sql` policy-tag taxonomy / data policies) for the affected objects so the BigQuery policy tags match the new source masking. Record which columns changed and that the policy-tag regeneration is required (do not silently let masking drift — a dropped masking policy that isn't re-applied is a data-exposure risk; a new one that isn't applied breaks the consuming role).

### Step 5b: Stale NULL-pad restore hook (`STALE_NULL_PAD_BRONZE_PRESENT`)

Read the pair's **"Deployment-integration / provenance defect patterns"** section (rule 4) — this is the one rule of that set that belongs in drift, because the column it watches for lands *after* generation, and only a gate that runs against the moving source can see it.

At translation time, `dbt-migration-generate` Step 3.1 item b substitutes `CAST(NULL AS <type>) /* -- MARKET GAP: <col> not present in <markets> ... */` for a source column absent in one or more markets. The connector can later catch up and the column can start carrying real data. For every `state = migrated`/`drifted` model whose translated SQL carries a `-- MARKET GAP:` NULL-pad, re-check the named source column against the **live** source warehouse (the same schema introspection Step 2's diff uses) for the previously-missing market(s):

- If the column is now **present and populated** in the live source for any of the affected markets, flag a **stale NULL-pad** finding: name the model, the column, the market(s) that now carry it, and the synthesized type from the marker. This is **flag-for-restore only** — never auto-rewritten here. Restoring the real column mapping and type is a re-translation decision (`/wire:dbt-migration-generate $ARGUMENTS --select <model>`), not a mechanical edit; note that in the finding.
- If the column is still absent in every affected market, leave the NULL-pad as-is (no finding).

Record each stale NULL-pad in the drift report (Step 6) and set the model's register `state = drifted` (its translation no longer matches the source) with a `notes` entry naming the restored column. Do not silently leave a column synthesizing NULL once the source carries real data — that is a widening, invisible data gap.

### Step 5c: Cross-release triggers (tenant carve-out, #180)

Applies only when `migration.cross_release_triggers` in status.md is non-empty (a carve-out tracking a live parent release). A carve-out inherits the parent's translations, backfills, and defects, and the dependencies between the two releases go stale exactly like blocker notes do — "closes when the parent completes its Bronze backfill" is a caveat nobody re-tests unless a gate does.

For each trigger with `status: open`:

1. **Evaluate the condition** against the parent release's current state — read the parent register at `.wire/releases/<trigger.parent_release>/migration/migration_register.csv` (and, where the condition names them, the parent's verdict log or drift report). A condition is met only by evidence read this run, never by the trigger's age.
2. **When met**, set `status: fired` in status.md and surface the trigger's `action` in the drift report: the dependent carve-out models to re-verify (resolved via the register's `parent_release` / `parent_model` linkage columns), the command to run, and the event that fired.
3. **Parent defect-class propagation.** When the parent release records a defect-class sweep (`equivalency-sweep`) whose pattern hits models this carve-out relocated, mark each relocated copy **re-verify-owed**: append a `notes` entry naming the parent sweep and pattern id, and list the models in the drift report. Their standing verdicts are stale evidence — the parent's fix does not re-prove the copy.
4. A trigger stays `fired` until the surfaced re-verifications complete (the drift report lists it every run); the consultant closes it (`status: closed`) once the dependent register rows carry fresh verdicts.

### Step 6: Write the drift report

**Output location**: `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/migration/migration_drift_report.md`

Use `TEMPLATES/migration/migration_drift_report.md`. Include: `drift_head` and the run timestamp; counts (modified / removed / new / unchanged); the per-model drift table (model, classification, change summary, prior equivalence state); the flagged downstream syncs with their config diffs; the masking changes with the policy-tag regeneration actions; the **stale NULL-pad restores** (Step 5b) — each flagged model, column, now-present market(s), and synthesized type, marked flag-for-restore; and the **cross-release triggers** (Step 5c) — each fired trigger with its event, the dependent re-verifications, and the re-verify-owed relocated models. Re-write the affected register rows (Step 2, Step 5b, and Step 5c item 3).

### Step 7: Update status

```yaml
artifacts:
  migration_drift:
    generate: complete
    file: migration/migration_drift_report.md
    last_run_date: "{{TODAY}}"
    drift_head: "<commit>"
    modified: N
    removed: N
    new: N
    syncs_flagged: N
    masking_changes: N
    stale_null_pads: N        # STALE_NULL_PAD_BRONZE_PRESENT — MARKET GAP columns now present in the live source, flagged for restore
    cross_release_triggers_fired: N   # carve-out only — triggers whose condition was met this run (Step 5c)
```

### Step 8: Output next command

```
/wire:migration-drift-validate $ARGUMENTS
```

If any models drifted: re-migrate them (`/wire:dbt-migration-generate $ARGUMENTS --select <drifted models>`), then re-run equivalency in baseline mode and, where masking changed, re-run `target-setup`.

## Scheduling

This gate is meant to run unattended. Deploy it two ways (templates in `TEMPLATES/migration/ci/`):

- **Scheduled** — `migration-drift-schedule.yml`: a cron GitHub Actions workflow on the delivery repo that refreshes the source and runs this drift check (e.g. nightly), opening/annotating an issue when drift is found.
- **On-change CI** — `migrated-model-ci.yml`: on any change to a migrated model (path filter derived from the register's `source_path` column), re-run compile + the tiered sweep (Tier 1 `dbt-migration-lint` + Tier 3 `equivalency-validate --baseline`).

## Output Files

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/migration/migration_drift_report.md`
- Updated `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/migration/migration_register.csv`
- Updated `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/status.md`


## Post-Execution Hooks

After updating `status.md`, run these in sequence:

1. **Execution log** — Append one row to `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/execution_log.md` following `specs/utils/execution_log.md`.

2. **Jira sync** — Follow `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `migration_drift` as artifact, `generate` as action.

3. **Document store** — Follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `migration_drift` as artifact_id, `Migration Drift` as artifact_name, and the `file` value from `artifacts.migration_drift` in status.md as file_path.

4. **Auto-commit** — Follow `specs/utils/commit.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as release_folder, `migration_drift` as artifact, `generate` as action.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

---
description: Internal utility — appends a log entry to the project's execution log after any generate/validate/review workflow or skill activation
---

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |

| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Stale Status Check

Immediately after appending a **command** row (this does not apply to skill activation entries), perform a quick freshness check against the project's `status.md`. This is additive to the logging behavior above — it never blocks the calling command and never modifies `status.md`.

**Process**:
1. Derive `artifact_id` from the command just logged: strip the `/wire:` prefix and the trailing `-generate`, `-validate`, or `-review` suffix (e.g. `/wire:migration-inventory-generate` → `migration_inventory`). If the command doesn't map to a recognizable artifact (e.g. `/wire:new`, `/wire:status`, `/wire:archive`), skip this check entirely.
2. Read the artifact's own block in `status.md`: `artifacts.<artifact_id>`.
3. Check whether that artifact has already passed its review/approval gate — its `review` field (or equivalent approval field) shows `pass`, `approved`, or `complete`.
4. If the gate has passed, scan every field in the `artifacts.<artifact_id>` block for a value that is still the literal string `TBD`, or an empty list (`[]`) / `null` where the artifact's own template expects a populated value (i.e. the field is not legitimately optional).
5. For each stale field found, emit a one-line warning in the command's output:
   ```
   ⚠ status.md still shows `<field>: TBD` for `<artifact_id>` despite review: pass — status may be stale
   ```
   Emit one warning per stale field — do not suppress after the first.
6. After the last warning (only when at least one was emitted), add one closing line offering the repair path:
   ```
   Run /wire:status-sync <release-folder> to reconcile the record (see specs/utils/status_sync.md).
   ```
   The offer is informational only — never block the calling command and never run the sync automatically.
7. If no stale fields are found, the review/approval gate has not yet passed, or `artifact_id` could not be derived: no output, proceed silently.

This check is self-contained within this utility, so every caller gets it automatically without any caller-side changes.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
