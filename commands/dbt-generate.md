# Generate dbt models

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command
- `specs/<path>.md` references are shared workflow docs shipped with this plugin — read them from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/specs/<path>.md`. If the path matches a Wire command (e.g. `specs/requirements/generate.md`), it means that command (`/wire:requirements-generate`) and its spec is already embedded in the command file.

## Tracing (opt-in, off by default)

description: Internal utility — opt-in step-level execution tracing to .wire/releases/<release>/trace.jsonl when WIRE_TRACE=true
---

# Tracing — Detailed, Opt-In, Step-Level Execution Trace

## Purpose

`execution_log.md` records one terse row per whole command (timestamp, command, result, a detail string capped at 120 characters). That's enough for a normal audit trail, but it can't answer "what actually happened inside that command, step by step" — which specific files it read, what it inferred, what it proposed, what a consultant decided, why. Tracing exists for engagements that want that depth: a complete, structured, append-only record of every step of every command, scoped to the release and release type it ran under.

**Off by default.** Tracing never runs unless `WIRE_TRACE=true` is set in the shell environment. If it isn't, skip this entire section — do nothing, check nothing further, proceed straight to the Workflow Specification exactly as if this section didn't exist. This is the common case and must add zero overhead.

## Where it writes

`.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl` — one JSON object per line (JSON Lines), append-only, alongside that release's `status.md` and `execution_log.md`.

For commands not scoped to a specific release (cross-cutting utilities with `release_types: []` in their own front-matter, or any command whose argument isn't a release folder), write to `.wire/trace.jsonl` at the engagement level instead, with `release` and `release_type` fields set to `null`.

This file is **local only** — nothing in it is ever sent anywhere, unlike the anonymous Segment telemetry event described elsewhere. It stays on the consultant's machine, inside the engagement's own repo, exactly like `execution_log.md`.

## What to log, and when

If `WIRE_TRACE=true`:

1. **Resolve context once, before anything else**: the release folder (from this command's own argument, if it has one) and `release_type` (read `.wire/releases/<release_folder>/status.md`'s `project_type` or `release_type` field). If this command has no release-folder argument, both are `null`.
2. **Emit a `command_start` event** before beginning the Workflow Specification below.
3. **As you work through the Workflow Specification's own numbered steps, emit a `step` event after completing each one** — and where a step itself has meaningfully distinct numbered sub-parts (e.g. "check location A, then location B, then infer a match, then propose it"), treat each of those as its own step event too rather than collapsing them into one. The `detail` field has no length limit and is not a summary — write what actually happened: values found, files read, decisions made and why, what was proposed and what the consultant chose. If this step involved the data model registry or any other external/optional resource, log it explicitly: whether it was reached, what was searched, what matched (or didn't, and why not), and whether/how the result was used downstream.
4. **Emit a `command_end` event** when the workflow finishes, with the same `result` value this command would write to `execution_log.md` (`complete`, `pass`, `fail`, `approved`, etc.).

## How to emit an event

Use this pattern for every event (adjust the heredoc body and the Python literals per call — this is a template, not a fixed script):

```bash
[ "${WIRE_TRACE:-false}" = "true" ] && {
  mkdir -p ".wire/releases/<release_folder>" 2>/dev/null
  cat > "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt" << 'WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF'
<the full, untruncated detail text for this event — safe to include quotes,
newlines, code snippets, anything; this heredoc is not shell-interpreted>
WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF
  python3 -c "
import json, datetime
detail = open('/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt').read().rstrip('\n')
event = {
    'ts': datetime.datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'),
    'release': '<release_folder_or_null>',
    'release_type': '<release_type_or_null>',
    'command': 'dbt-generate',
    'event': '<command_start|step|command_end>',
    'step': '<step_number_or_null>',
    'step_name': '<step_heading_or_null>',
    'result': '<result_value_or_null>',
    'detail': detail,
}
with open('.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl', 'a') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(event) + chr(10))
"
  rm -f "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt"
}
```

- `<release_folder_or_null>` / `<release_type_or_null>`: from Step 1 above; write the literal JSON `null` (no quotes) if either doesn't apply, or a quoted string if it does.
- `event`: `command_start`, `step`, or `command_end`.
- `step` / `step_name`: `null` for `command_start`/`command_end`; the step's own number (e.g. `"1.5"`) and heading (e.g. `"Check for a Canonical Vertical Match"`) for a `step` event.
- `result`: `null` except on `command_end`.
- Adjust the file path in the final `open(...)` call to `.wire/trace.jsonl` for engagement-level (non-release-scoped) commands.

## Rules

1. **Never block or fail the workflow.** If a trace write fails for any reason (disk full, permissions), continue the workflow regardless — trace failures are never surfaced to the user and never stop anything.
2. **Append only** — never rewrite or delete existing lines in `trace.jsonl`.
3. **This is additive to `execution_log.md` and Telemetry, not a replacement for either.** All three continue exactly as documented elsewhere; tracing is a separate, optional, much finer-grained record for engagements that opt in.
4. **Don't summarize into brevity.** The entire point of this mechanism over `execution_log.md` is that it isn't limited to a 120-character line — write the real detail.

## Automatic Validation (on by default)

---
description: Internal utility — injected auto-validate section so generate commands run their matching validate step automatically and fold the result into their output
---

Every `generate` command that has a matching `validate` command for the
same artifact runs that validate step automatically as part of generate —
by default, with no separate command to remember. This section only appears
on commands where that applies; artifacts with no separate validate step at
all (e.g. mockups, workshops, UAT) never carry this section.

## Step: Check `auto_validate`

Read this command's own `auto_validate` front-matter field, in the Workflow
Specification below. Two states:

- **Absent, or `true`** (the default — most artifacts): auto-validate runs.
- **`false`**: this artifact's validate step is expensive — it runs real
  code, queries a live warehouse or BI tool, or otherwise does IO beyond
  re-reading local files — so it does not run automatically. Skip to
  "If `auto_validate: false`" below.

## If `auto_validate` is absent or `true`: run validate automatically

Once this command finishes writing its artifact, before ending:

1. Run this artifact's own `/wire:<artifact-with-dashes>-validate` workflow
   in full, exactly as if the consultant had typed it themselves — same
   inputs, same `status.md` write to `artifacts.<artifact>.validate`, same
   report. This is not optional or an extra step layered on top; it is the
   default behavior for this artifact.
2. Fold the result into this command's own closing output rather than
   presenting it as a separate command run:
   - **PASS** — add a single closing line: `✅ Auto-validated — PASS`. The
     full report already went to `status.md`/`execution_log.md`, exactly as
     it would from a standalone validate run — no need to repeat it here.
   - **FAIL** — surface the validate command's own failure report in full,
     exactly as running validate standalone would show it, so the
     consultant sees what's wrong immediately without running anything
     else themselves.
3. This never blocks or undoes generate itself — the artifact is written
   either way, and its content is never rolled back because validate
   failed. Auto-validation only means validate has already run and its
   result is already on record by the time generate finishes, instead of
   waiting for the consultant to remember to run it separately.

## If `auto_validate` is `false`: state this plainly, don't run it

Do not run validate. End with a line naming why, as specifically as this
spec's own context makes possible (e.g. "runs `dbt run`/`dbt test`",
"queries the live target warehouse", "calls the Looker API directly") —
fall back to "performs live checks against an external system" only if no
more specific reason is evident from context:

```
⚠ This artifact's validate step [reason] and does not run automatically.
Run /wire:<artifact-with-dashes>-validate <release_folder> before
requesting review — review is blocked until it passes.
```

## Why this is always safe either way

`review` already requires `validate: PASS` for this same artifact as one of
its own declared preconditions (see `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md`) —
this is existing, independent enforcement, not something added by this
section. So an `auto_validate: false` opt-out never lets an artifact reach
review unvalidated; it only decides *when* the consultant pays validate's
cost — automatically on every draft (the default), or once, on their own
schedule, before requesting review (the opt-out). Auto-validation is a
convenience that closes the "forgot to run it" gap for the common case; the
gate that actually prevents unvalidated work from being reviewed was already
there.

# dbt Generate Command

## Purpose

Generate dbt models based on the data model design, following best practices for layered architecture. Creates staging, integration, and warehouse models with appropriate tests, documentation, and naming conventions.

> **Per-layer alternative**: For very large dbt projects where you want to review/commit each layer independently rather than generating all three in one pass, use the per-layer commands instead: `/wire:dbt-staging-generate` → `/wire:dbt-staging-validate` → `/wire:dbt-integration-generate` → `/wire:dbt-integration-validate` → `/wire:dbt-warehouse-generate` → `/wire:dbt-warehouse-validate`, run in that order.

## Prerequisites

**Default** (all project types except `dashboard_first`):

**Required Artifacts (must be complete)**:
- `requirements`: Requirements specification
- `data_model`: dbt model design specification

**Optional**:
- `pipeline_design`: Understanding of data sources
- Existing dbt project structure

**Dashboard-first** (`dashboard_first` project type):

**Required Artifacts (must be complete)**:
- `requirements`: Requirements specification
- `data_model`: dbt model design specification
- `seed_data`: `review: approved` — provides CSV seed files for initial data

**Seed-based generation notes**:
When `project_type` is `dashboard_first`, the dbt project should:
1. Use `ref('seed_name')` in staging models instead of `source('source_name', 'table_name')`
2. Include seed configuration in `dbt_project.yml` (seed paths, schema overrides)
3. Read seed files from `.wire/<project_id>/dev/seed_data/` and include them in the dbt project's `seeds/` directory
4. Generate source definitions that map to seed tables rather than external databases
5. Keep the staging model SQL compatible with later refactoring to real sources (use the `data_refactor` command when real data becomes available)

## Inputs

**From data_model artifact**:
- Source system schemas
- Target dimensional model design
- Transformation logic specifications
- Naming conventions
- Data quality requirements

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read Data Model Design

**Process**:
1. Read `.wire/<project_id>/design/data_model_specification.md`
2. Extract:
   - Source systems and tables
   - Staging layer specifications
   - Integration layer transformations
   - Warehouse layer dimensions and facts
   - Naming conventions
   - Required tests

### Step 1.5: Load Convention Source

**Priority Order (2-tier system):**

1. **Project-specific conventions** (highest priority)
   - Check for `.dbt-conventions.md` in project root
   - Check for `dbt_coding_conventions.md` in project root
   - Check for `docs/dbt_conventions.md` in project

2. **Embedded conventions** (fallback — use the conventions defined in this spec)

**Detection:**
- Use Glob to search for convention files in project root
- If found, read and use project conventions
- If not found, use the embedded conventions below
- Note which source is being used in generated output

### Step 2: Determine dbt Project Location

**Process**:
1. Check if dbt project exists in repository
2. Common locations:
   - `dbt/` or `dbt_project/` at root
   - `transform/` at root
   - Within client folder

**Ask user if location is ambiguous:**
```
Where should I create the dbt models?

Options:
1. Existing dbt project at: [detected path]
2. Create new dbt project
3. Specify custom path
```

For this guide, assume dbt project root is at: `dbt/`

### Step 3: Generate Staging Models

**Purpose**: Clean and standardize raw source data

#### Field Naming Conventions

All generated models MUST follow these naming conventions:

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Primary Key | `<entity>_pk`, generated via `dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(...)` | `user_pk`, `transaction_pk` |
| Foreign Key | `<referenced_entity>_fk`, generated via `dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(...)` | `user_fk`, `account_fk` |
| Natural Key | `<descriptive_name>_natural_key` | `salesforce_user_natural_key` |
| Date | `<event>_dt` | `user_created_dt` |
| Timestamp (UTC) | `<event>_ts` — always assumed UTC unless otherwise indicated | `created_ts`, `updated_ts`, `order_placed_ts` |
| Timestamp (non-UTC) | `<event>_<tz>_ts` — timezone tag inserted before `_ts` | `created_cet_ts`, `created_pt_ts` |
| Boolean | `is_<state>`, `has_<thing>`, or `was_<event>` | `is_active`, `has_subscription`, `was_refunded` |
| Revenue / Money | `<entity>_<measure>_amount` — decimal currency, converted from cents at the staging layer | `user_account_balance_amount` (not `price_in_cents`) |
| Common fields | `<entity>_<field>` | `customer_name`, `carrier_name` (not just `name`) |

**General Rules:**
- All names in `snake_case`
- Use business terminology, not source terminology
- Avoid SQL reserved words
- Consistency across models (same field names for same concepts)
- All objects are SINGULAR (e.g., `user` not `users`)

**Key Generation:**
- Primary keys: Generated using `{{ dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(['source_id', 'source_system']) }}`
- Foreign keys: Generated using `{{ dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(['referenced_id', 'source_system']) }}`
- Natural keys: Preserved from source as `<source>_<entity>_natural_key`

**Type Casting:**
- Always use dbt's type-cast macros, never raw SQL types: `{{ dbt.type_string() }}`, `{{ dbt.type_numeric() }}`, `{{ dbt.type_boolean() }}`, `{{ dbt.type_timestamp() }}`, `{{ type_date() }}` (community macro, no `dbt.` prefix)
- This keeps models portable across warehouses (BigQuery / Snowflake / Databricks / Postgres)

#### Field Ordering Rules

Fields in all models should follow this ordering:

1. **Keys** — pk, fks, natural keys
2. **Attributes** — dimensions, slicing fields, descriptive columns (alphabetical within)
3. **Indexes / ranks** — `row_number()`, rank columns, sequence positions
4. **Metrics** — measures, aggregatable values, `_amount` columns (alphabetical within)
5. **Booleans** — `is_*`, `has_*`, `was_*` flags
6. **Temporal data types** — `_dt`, `_ts` columns last

#### SQL Style Rules

All generated SQL MUST follow these style conventions:

| Rule | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Indentation | 4 spaces (not tabs) |
| Line length | Max 80 characters |
| Case | Lowercase field names and SQL functions |
| Aliases | Always use `as` keyword |
| Joins | Explicit: `inner join`, `left join` (never just `join`) |
| Table aliases in joins | Use full descriptive names, not initialisms (`customer`, not `c`) |
| Column prefixes | Required when joining 2+ tables |
| CTEs from refs/sources | Prefix with `s_` (e.g., `s_salesforce_contact`) |
| Transformation CTEs | Descriptive names (e.g., `filtered_events`, `aggregated_metrics`) |
| Final CTE | Always name `final` and `select * from final` at end |
| Union | Prefer `union all` to `union distinct` |
| Group by | Use column names, not numbers |
| Comments | Add for confusing CTEs; explain WHY, not WHAT |

**Required SQL Structure:**
```sql
with

s_source_table as (
    select * from {{ ref('source_model') }}
),

s_another_source as (
    select * from {{ ref('another_model') }}
),

-- Comment explaining transformation logic
transformation_cte as (
    select
        field_one,
        field_two
    from s_source_table
),

final as (
    select
        transformation_cte.field_one,
        s_another_source.field_two
    from transformation_cte
    left join s_another_source
        on transformation_cte.id = s_another_source.id
)

select * from final
```

#### Key Principles

1. **Only staging models select from sources** (via `{{ source() }}`)
2. **All other models select from other models** (via `{{ ref() }}`)
3. **All refs go in CTEs at the top** — never inline
4. **Always have a `final` CTE** to select from
5. **One CTE = one logical unit of work**
6. **Prefer creating integration layer** even if just `select *`
7. **Aggregations should happen early**, before joins
8. **Newlines are cheap, brain time is expensive** — optimize for readability

---

**For each source table, create:**

**File**: `dbt/models/staging/<source_system>/stg_<source>__<table>.sql`

**Template**:
```sql
{{
    config(
        materialized='view',
        tags=['staging', '<source_system>']
    )
}}

with

s_<source_system>_<table> as (
    select * from {{ source('<source_system>', '<table_name>') }}
),

final as (
    select
        -- Keys
        {{ dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(['<id_column>']) }}
            as <table>_pk,
        <id_column> as <source>_<table>_natural_key,
        <foreign_key_column> as <referenced_table>_fk,

        -- Attributes (renamed for consistency)
        lower(trim(<source_column>)) as <standard_name>,

        -- Metrics
        cast(<numeric_column> as {{ dbt.type_numeric() }}) as <metric_name>,

        -- Booleans
        case
            when is_deleted = 'true' then true
            else false
        end as is_deleted,

        -- Temporal data types
        cast(<date_column> as {{ dbt.type_timestamp() }}) as <event>_ts,
        _fivetran_synced as source_updated_ts,
        current_timestamp() as dbt_loaded_ts

    from s_<source_system>_<table>
    where is_deleted = 'false'  -- Filter out deleted records
)

select * from final
```

**Also create**: `dbt/models/staging/<source_system>/stg_<source_system>.yml`

```yaml
version: 2

sources:
  - name: <source_system>
    database: "{{ var('source_database') }}"
    schema: "{{ var('source_schema') }}"
    tables:
      - name: <table_name>
        description: "[Description from data model design]"
        columns:
          - name: <column>
            description: "[Description]"
            tests:
              - not_null
              - unique

models:
  - name: stg_<source>__<table>
    description: "Staging model for <table>"
    columns:
      - name: <table>_pk
        description: "Surrogate key"
        tests:
          - not_null
          - unique
```

### Step 4: Generate Integration Models

**Purpose**: Business logic and complex transformations

**Types of integration models:**

#### Intermediate Models (`int_<group>__<entity>__<action>.sql`)

For complex multi-step transformations (action is a past-tense verb, e.g. `unioned`, `deduped`):

**File**: `dbt/models/integration/int_<group>/intermediate/int_<group>__<entity>__<action>.sql`

**Example**: `int_core__student__extended_data.sql`

```sql
{{
    config(
        materialized='ephemeral',
        tags=['integration', 'intermediate']
    )
}}

with student_base as (

    select * from {{ ref('stg_<source_name>__<entity>') }}

),

extended_data_flags as (

    select * from {{ ref('stg_<source_name>__<entity>_detail') }}

),

joined as (

    select
        student_base.*,
        extended_data_flags.is_sen,
        extended_data_flags.is_free_meals,
        extended_data_flags.is_bursary

    from student_base
    left join extended_data_flags
        on student_base.student_pk = extended_data_flags.student_fk

)

select * from joined
```

#### Final Integration Models (`int_<group>__<entity>.sql`)

**File**: `dbt/models/integration/int_<group>/int_<group>__<entity>.sql`

```sql
{{
    config(
        materialized='view',
        tags=['integration']
    )
}}

with student_extended as (

    select * from {{ ref('int_core__student__extended_data') }}

),

demographics as (

    select * from {{ ref('int_core__student__demographics') }}

),

final as (

    select
        student_extended.student_pk,
        student_extended.student_id,
        student_extended.forename,
        student_extended.surname,
        demographics.ethnic_group,
        demographics.is_ethnically_diverse,
        student_extended.is_sen,
        student_extended.is_free_meals,
        -- Derived fields
        case
            when student_extended.is_sen = true
                or student_extended.is_free_meals = true
            then true
            else false
        end as is_access_plus

    from student_extended
    left join demographics
        on student_extended.student_pk = demographics.student_fk

)

select * from final
```

### Step 5: Generate Warehouse Models

**Purpose**: Dimensional model ready for BI consumption

#### Dimension Tables (`wh_<group>__<entity>_dim.sql`)

**File**: `dbt/models/warehouse/wh_<group>/wh_<group>__<entity>_dim.sql`

**For SCD Type 1 (current state only)**:
```sql
{{
    config(
        materialized='table',
        tags=['warehouse', 'dimension'],
        cluster_by=['<primary_key>']
    )
}}

with base as (

    select * from {{ ref('int_<group>__<entity>') }}

),

final as (

    select
        -- Keys
        <entity>_pk,
        <entity>_natural_key,

        -- Attributes
        <attribute_1>,
        <attribute_2>,

        -- Temporal data types
        current_timestamp() as dbt_updated_ts

    from base

)

select * from final
```

**For SCD Type 2 (historical tracking)**:
```sql
{{
    config(
        materialized='incremental',
        unique_key='<entity>_pk',
        tags=['warehouse', 'dimension', 'scd2'],
        cluster_by=['<entity>_id']
    )
}}

with base as (

    select * from {{ ref('int_<group>__<entity>') }}

),

add_temporal_columns as (

    select
        *,
        current_timestamp() as valid_from,
        cast('9999-12-31' as {{ dbt.type_timestamp() }}) as valid_to,
        true as is_current

    from base

)

{% if is_incremental() %}

-- SCD Type 2 logic (detect changes and version records)
...

{% endif %}

select * from add_temporal_columns
```

#### Fact Tables (`wh_<group>__<entity>_fact.sql`)

**File**: `dbt/models/warehouse/wh_<group>/wh_<group>__<entity>_fact.sql`

```sql
{{
    config(
        materialized='table',
        tags=['warehouse', 'fact'],
        cluster_by=['<date_key>', '<dimension_fk>']
    )
}}

with base as (

    select * from {{ ref('stg_<source>__<table>') }}

),

dimension_joins as (

    select
        base.*,
        dim1.dim1_pk,
        dim2.dim2_pk

    from base
    left join {{ ref('wh_<group>__dim1_dim') }} as dim1
        on base.dim1_id = dim1.dim1_id
    left join {{ ref('wh_<group>__dim2_dim') }} as dim2
        on base.dim2_id = dim2.dim2_id

),

final as (

    select
        -- Keys
        {{ dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(['<id_columns>']) }} as <fact>_pk,
        dim1_pk as dim1_fk,
        dim2_pk as dim2_fk,

        -- Metrics
        <measure_1_amount>,
        <measure_2_amount>,

        -- Booleans
        case when <condition> then true else false end as <flag>,

        -- Temporal data types
        current_timestamp() as dbt_updated_ts

    from dimension_joins

)

select * from final
```

#### Aggregate Tables (`wh_<group>__<entity>_agg.sql`)

**File**: `dbt/models/warehouse/wh_<group>/wh_<group>__<entity>_agg.sql`

```sql
{{
    config(
        materialized='table',
        tags=['warehouse', 'aggregate'],
        cluster_by=['<dimension_fk>']
    )
}}

with fact as (

    select * from {{ ref('wh_<group>__<entity>_fact') }}

),

aggregated as (

    select
        <dimension_fk>,
        <grouping_column>,

        -- Aggregated Measures
        count(*) as total_count,
        sum(<measure>) as total_<measure>_amount,
        avg(<measure>) as avg_<measure>_amount

    from fact
    group by 1, 2

)

select * from aggregated
```

#### Cross-Attribute / Bridge Tables (`wh_<group>__<entity>_xa.sql`)

**File**: `dbt/models/warehouse/wh_<group>/wh_<group>__<entity>_xa.sql`

For bridge / many-to-many / cross-entity attribute models (e.g. user-to-role, product-to-category), joining two or more dimension surrogate keys with no measures of their own.

### Step 5.5: Multi-Source Framework (If Applicable)

When integrating data from **multiple source systems** where the same entities (companies, contacts, products) exist across sources with different IDs and attributes, use this framework pattern.

**When to use:** The data model design identifies multiple sources for the same entity (e.g., companies from HubSpot + Xero + Harvest).

#### Architecture Overview

```
Sources Layer (stg_*) → Integration Layer (int_<group>__*) → Warehouse Layer (wh_<group>__*_dim/*_fact)
```

| Layer | Purpose | Naming | Materialization |
|-------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| **Sources** | Source-specific transformations, column standardization, ID prefixing | `stg_<source>__<object>.sql` | view |
| **Integration** | Cross-source entity resolution, deduplication, merging | `int_<group>__<object>.sql` | view or table |
| **Warehouse** | Final dimensional models with surrogate keys | `wh_<group>__<object>_dim.sql`, `wh_<group>__<object>_fact.sql` | table |

#### Configuration-Driven Source Management

Add source enablement variables to `dbt_project.yml`:

```yaml
# dbt_project.yml
vars:
  # Source enablement arrays - add/remove sources as needed
  crm_warehouse_company_sources: ['hubspot_crm', 'xero_accounting', 'harvest_projects']
  crm_warehouse_contact_sources: ['hubspot_crm', 'mailchimp_email', 'harvest_projects']
  finance_warehouse_invoice_sources: ['xero_accounting', 'harvest_projects']

  # Per-source configuration
  stg_hubspot_crm_id-prefix: 'hubspot-'
  stg_hubspot_crm_etl: 'fivetran'
  stg_hubspot_crm_schema: 'fivetran_hubspot'

  stg_xero_accounting_id-prefix: 'xero-'
  stg_xero_accounting_etl: 'fivetran'
  stg_xero_accounting_schema: 'fivetran_xero'

  # Feature flags
  enable_companies_merge_file: true
```

#### Step 1: Source Layer — Conditional Compilation with ID Prefixing

Each source model checks if enabled before compiling and prefixes all IDs:

```sql
-- models/sources/stg_hubspot_crm/stg_hubspot_crm__company.sql

{% if var("crm_warehouse_company_sources") %}
{% if 'hubspot_crm' in var("crm_warehouse_company_sources") %}

{% if var("stg_hubspot_crm_etl") == 'fivetran' %}
with source as (
    select * from {{ source('fivetran_hubspot_crm', 'company') }}
    where not _fivetran_deleted
)
{% elif var("stg_hubspot_crm_etl") == 'stitch' %}
with source as (
    select * from {{ source('stitch_hubspot_crm', 'companies') }}
    qualify row_number() over (
        partition by companyid order by _sdc_batched_at desc
    ) = 1
)
{% endif %}

renamed as (
    select
        -- PRIMARY KEY: Prefixed with source identifier
        concat(
            '{{ var("stg_hubspot_crm_id-prefix") }}',
            cast(companyid as {{ dbt.type_string() }})
        ) as company_id,

        -- BUSINESS KEY: Standardized for matching across sources
        trim(regexp_replace(
            regexp_replace(
                properties_name,
                r'(?i)\s*(Limited|Ltd\.?|Inc\.?|LLC|Corp\.?)$', ''
            ),
            r'\s+', ' '
        )) as company_name,

        -- STANDARDIZED ATTRIBUTES
        lower(trim(properties_website)) as company_website,
        properties_industry as company_industry,
        properties_phone as company_phone,

        -- TIMESTAMPS
        cast(properties_createdate as {{ dbt.type_timestamp() }})
            as company_created_ts,
        cast(properties_hs_lastmodifieddate as {{ dbt.type_timestamp() }})
            as company_last_modified_ts,

        -- SOURCE METADATA
        'hubspot_crm' as source_system,
        current_timestamp() as _loaded_ts

    from source
    where properties_name is not null
)

select * from renamed

{% endif %}
{% else %} {{ config(enabled=false) }} {% endif %}
```

#### Step 2: Create merge_sources Macro

**File**: `dbt/macros/merge_sources.sql`

```sql
{% macro merge_sources(sources, model_suffix) %}
(
    {% set relations_list = [] %}

    {% for source in sources %}
        {% do relations_list.append(ref("stg_" ~ source ~ model_suffix)) %}
    {% endfor %}

    {{ dbt_utils.union_relations(
        relations=relations_list,
        source_column_name='_dbt_source_relation'
    ) }}
)
{% endmacro %}
```

#### Step 3: Integration Layer — Entity Deduplication and Merging

```sql
-- models/integration/int_crm/int_crm__company.sql

{% if var('crm_warehouse_company_sources') %}

with companies_unioned as (
    {{ merge_sources(
        sources=var('crm_warehouse_company_sources'),
        model_suffix='__company'
    ) }}
),

-- Collect all source IDs into arrays
all_company_ids as (
    select
        company_name,
        array_agg(distinct company_id ignore nulls) as all_company_ids
    from companies_unioned
    where company_name is not null
      and trim(company_name) != ''
    group by 1
),

-- Deduplicate attributes by taking best/max values
companies_grouped as (
    select
        company_name,
        max(company_website) as company_website,
        max(company_industry) as company_industry,
        max(company_phone) as company_phone,
        min(company_created_ts) as company_created_ts,
        max(company_last_modified_ts) as company_last_modified_ts,
        count(distinct source_system) as source_count,
        array_agg(distinct source_system ignore nulls) as source_systems
    from companies_unioned
    where company_name is not null
    group by 1
),

final as (
    select
        g.*,
        a.all_company_ids
    from companies_grouped g
    join all_company_ids a on g.company_name = a.company_name
)

select * from final

{% else %} {{ config(enabled=false) }} {% endif %}
```

#### Step 4: Warehouse Layer — Dimension with Surrogate Key

```sql
-- models/warehouse/wh_crm/wh_crm__company_dim.sql

{% if var("crm_warehouse_company_sources") %}

{{ config(materialized='table', unique_key='company_pk') }}

with companies as (
    select * from {{ ref('int_crm__company') }}
),

final as (
    select
        {{ dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(['company_name']) }}
            as company_pk,
        company_name,
        company_website,
        company_industry,
        company_phone,
        company_created_ts,
        company_last_modified_ts,
        source_count,
        all_company_ids
    from companies
)

select * from final

{% else %} {{ config(enabled=false) }} {% endif %}
```

#### Step 5: Fact Table Joins Using Source ID Arrays

```sql
-- Join fact tables to dimensions using the array of source IDs:

with invoices as (
    select * from {{ ref('int_finance__invoice') }}
),

companies_dim as (
    select * from {{ ref('wh_crm__company_dim') }}
),

final as (
    select
        {{ dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(['i.invoice_number']) }}
            as invoice_pk,
        c.company_pk as company_fk,
        i.invoice_number,
        i.invoice_amount,
        i.invoice_status,
        i.invoice_created_ts
    from invoices i
    -- JOIN using UNNEST to match any source system ID
    left join companies_dim c
        on i.company_id in unnest(c.all_company_ids)
)

select * from final
```

#### Multi-Source Directory Structure

```

```

#### Adding a New Source

1. Add source to enablement array in `dbt_project.yml`
2. Add ID prefix and ETL variables
3. Create source definition `.yml` file
4. Create staging model with conditional compilation
5. Test independently before enabling in integration

#### Removing a Source

1. Remove from source array in `dbt_project.yml`
2. Source models automatically disable via conditional compilation
3. Historical source IDs remain in dimension arrays for audit

#### Multi-Source Framework Checklist

**Configuration:**
- [ ] Source arrays defined in `dbt_project.yml` for each entity type
- [ ] ID prefix variables defined for each source
- [ ] ETL type variables defined if supporting multiple pipelines

**Source Layer:**
- [ ] Each source model checks if enabled before compiling
- [ ] All IDs prefixed with unique source identifier
- [ ] Column names standardized across all sources
- [ ] Entity names normalized (trim, remove Ltd/Inc suffixes)

**Integration Layer:**
- [ ] `merge_sources` macro used for dynamic unions
- [ ] Pre-merge model collects IDs into arrays
- [ ] Attributes deduplicated using MAX/MIN logic
- [ ] Source count tracked for data quality

**Warehouse Layer:**
- [ ] Surrogate keys generated from business keys (not source IDs)
- [ ] Source ID arrays preserved in dimension tables
- [ ] Fact tables join using `IN UNNEST()` pattern
- [ ] All conditional config blocks in place

### Step 6: Generate Model Documentation

#### Documentation Coverage Requirements

| Layer | Coverage | Details |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Staging | 100% | All models and columns must be documented |
| Warehouse | 100% | All models and columns must be documented |
| Integration | As needed | Document complex logic and special cases |

**Best Practices:**
- Use `{% docs %}` blocks for shared documentation (store in `models/docs/`)
- Focus on business terminology — explain WHY, not just WHAT
- Include business context for calculated fields
- Reference doc blocks for consistency: `description: "{{ doc('user_pk') }}"`

**Schema.yml Location:**
- Every subdirectory should contain a `.yml` file
- Named after directory: `stg_<group>.yml`, `int_<group>/integration.yml`, `wh_<group>.yml`

**File**: `dbt/models/warehouse/wh_<group>/wh_<group>.yml`

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: wh_<group>__<entity>_dim
    description: "Dimension table for <entity>"
    columns:
      - name: <entity>_pk
        description: "Surrogate primary key"
        tests:
          - not_null
          - unique
      - name: <entity>_natural_key
        description: "Natural key"
        tests:
          - not_null

  - name: wh_<group>__<entity>_fact
    description: "Fact table for <entity> at <grain> grain"
    columns:
      - name: <entity>_pk
        description: "Surrogate primary key"
        tests:
          - not_null
          - unique
      - name: <dimension>_fk
        description: "Foreign key to wh_<group>__<dimension>_dim"
        tests:
          - not_null
          - relationships:
              to: ref('wh_<group>__<dimension>_dim')
              field: <dimension>_pk
```

### Step 7: Generate Macros (if needed)

**File**: `dbt/macros/<macro_name>.sql`

**Example**: Calculate derived fields

```sql
{% macro calculate_access_plus(is_sen, is_free_meals) %}
    case
        when {{ is_sen }} = true or {{ is_free_meals }} = true
        then true
        else false
    end
{% endmacro %}
```

### Step 8: Generate dbt_project.yml Config (if new project)

**File**: `dbt/dbt_project.yml`

```yaml
name: '<client>_analytics'
version: '1.0.0'
config-version: 2

profile: '<client>_analytics'

model-paths: ["models"]
analysis-paths: ["analyses"]
test-paths: ["tests"]
seed-paths: ["seeds"]
macro-paths: ["macros"]

target-path: "target"
clean-targets:
  - "target"
  - "dbt_packages"

models:
  <client>_analytics:
    staging:
      +materialized: view
      +tags: ['staging']
    integration:
      +materialized: view
      +tags: ['integration']
    warehouse:
      +materialized: table
      +tags: ['warehouse']

vars:
  current_academic_year: '24/25'
  # Add project-specific variables
```

### Step 8.5: sqlfluff Configuration (If Applicable)

**Process:**
1. Check for existing `.sqlfluff` config file in the dbt project root
2. If not present, recommend creating one:

```ini
# .sqlfluff
[sqlfluff]
templater = dbt
dialect = bigquery
max_line_length = 80

[sqlfluff:indentation]
indent_unit = space
tab_space_size = 4

[sqlfluff:rules:capitalisation.keywords]
capitalisation_policy = lower

[sqlfluff:rules:capitalisation.functions]
capitalisation_policy = lower
```

3. Note that sqlfluff enforces many style conventions automatically (line length, indentation, capitalization, trailing commas, whitespace)
4. If sqlfluff is available, recommend running: `sqlfluff lint models/ --dialect bigquery`

### Step 9: Create Summary Document

**File**: `.wire/<project_id>/dev/dbt_models_summary.md`

```markdown
# dbt Models Summary

**Generated**: [Date]
**Project**: [Client Name]

## Models Created

### Staging Layer
[Table of staging models with descriptions]

### Integration Layer
[Table of integration models with descriptions]

### Warehouse Layer

#### Dimensions
[List of dimension tables]

#### Facts
[List of fact tables]

#### Aggregates
[List of aggregate tables]

## Testing Strategy

- [Count] uniqueness tests
- [Count] not null tests
- [Count] relationship tests
- [Count] custom tests

## Next Steps

1. Run dbt models: `/wire:utils-run-dbt <project_id>`
2. Validate models: `/wire:dbt-validate <project_id>`
3. Review with team: `/wire:dbt-review <project_id>`
```

### Step 10: Update Status

**Process**:
1. Read current status file
2. Update artifacts.dbt section:
   ```yaml
   dbt:
     generate: complete
     validate: not_started
     review: not_started
     models_count: [count]
     tests_count: [count]
     generated_date: 2026-02-13
   ```
3. Write updated status.md

### Step 10.5: Sync to Document Store (Optional)

If a document store is configured for this project, follow the workflow in `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`:
- `artifact_id`: `dbt`
- `artifact_name`: `dbt Models Summary`
- `file_path`: `.wire/<project_id>/dev/dbt_models_summary.md`
- `project_id`: the release folder path

If docstore sync fails, log the error and continue — do not block the generate command.

### Step 11: Sync to Jira (Optional)

Follow the Jira sync workflow in `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`:
- Artifact: `dbt`
- Action: `generate`
- Status: the generate state just written to status.md

### Step 12: Confirm and Suggest Next Steps

**Output**:

```
## dbt Models Generated Successfully

**Models Created**: [count]
- Staging: [count]
- Integration: [count]
- Warehouse: [count]

**Tests Configured**: [count]

with

s_salesforce_contact as (
    select * from {{ source('salesforce', 'contact') }}
),

final as (
    select
        -- Keys
        {{ dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(['id', "'salesforce'"]) }}
            as contact_pk,

### Quick Conventions Checklist

Before committing a dbt model:

- [ ] Filename follows the `<layer>_<group>__<entity>(_dim|_fact|_agg|_xa).sql` naming pattern (`stg_`, `int_<group>__`, `wh_<group>__`)
- [ ] File in the correct entity-group subfolder (`stg_<group>/`, `int_<group>/`, `warehouse/wh_<group>/`)
- [ ] All refs/sources in CTEs at top (prefixed with `s_`)
- [ ] Final CTE exists and is selected from
- [ ] 4-space indentation, < 80 char lines
- [ ] All fields lowercase
- [ ] Primary key: `<entity>_pk` generated via `dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key` (not `surrogate_key`)
- [ ] Foreign keys: `<entity>_fk` generated via `dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key`
- [ ] Dates: `_dt`. Timestamps: `_ts` (UTC) or `_<tz>_ts` (non-UTC, timezone before `_ts`)
- [ ] Booleans: `is_`, `has_`, or `was_` prefix
- [ ] Revenue / money columns: `_amount` suffix
- [ ] Type casts use `{{ dbt.type_*() }}` / `{{ type_date() }}` macros, not raw SQL types
- [ ] Explicit joins (`inner join`, `left join`)
- [ ] Field ordering correct: keys → attributes → indexes/ranks → metrics → booleans → temporal data types
- [ ] Configuration appropriate for layer
- [ ] Schema.yml entry exists
- [ ] Primary key has `unique` + `not_null` tests
- [ ] Model and columns documented (if staging/warehouse)
- [ ] Singular object names throughout

## Edge Cases

### No Data Model Design Found

If `data_model` artifact not complete:

```
Error: Data model design not found or incomplete.

Please complete the data model design first:
/wire:data_model-generate <project_id>

The data model design is required to generate dbt models.
```

### Existing dbt Models

If dbt models already exist for some tables:

1. Detect existing models
2. Ask user:
   ```
   Found existing dbt models for:
   - <model_1>
   - <model_2>

   How should I proceed?
   1. Skip existing models (only create new ones)
   2. Overwrite all models
   3. Create with different names (append _v2)
   ```

### dbt Project Not Found

If no dbt project exists:

```
No dbt project found. Would you like me to:

1. Create a new dbt project
2. Specify the dbt project location
3. Cancel (set up dbt project manually first)
```

## Validation Checks (for next step)

The validate command will:
- [ ] Run `dbt compile` (syntax check)
- [ ] Run `dbt test` (all tests pass)
- [ ] Check model dependencies (correct ref() usage)
- [ ] Validate naming conventions
- [ ] Check for circular dependencies

## Output Files

This command creates:
- Multiple `.sql` model files in `dbt/models/`
- Multiple `.yml` documentation files
- `.wire/<project_id>/dev/dbt_models_summary.md`
- Updates `.wire/<project_id>/status.md`

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

---
description: Internal utility — appends a log entry to the project's execution log after any generate/validate/review workflow or skill activation
---

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail | By | Session |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|----|---------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> | <by> | <session> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition, or an advisory gate satisfied by a director's ruling
  - `mode` — the director handed control over or took it back ("you drive" / "I'll drive"), per `specs/utils/director_operating_model.md`
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason
  - For a ruling-satisfied advisory gate: the precondition and the ruling id
- **By**: the git user (`git config user.name`), or `unknown` if git has no
  user configured. Who the run is attributable to, regardless of what typed it.
- **Session**: what invoked the run. One of:
  - `typed` — a person typed the command
  - `orchestrator` — the orchestrating session dispatched it, followed by its
    session id in brackets where one is available: `orchestrator [a1b2c3]`
  - a lane label — the lane that ran it, e.g. `dbt-developer [staging 1/2]`
  - `autopilot` — `/wire:autopilot` ran it

  This is the same value the `invoked_by` telemetry property carries
  (`specs/utils/telemetry.md`), read from `WIRE_INVOKED_BY` and defaulting to
  `typed`. The log records it per row so the record on disk answers the same
  question telemetry answers in aggregate.

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> | <by> | <session> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Stale Status Check

Immediately after appending a **command** row (this does not apply to skill activation entries), perform a quick freshness check against the project's `status.md`. This is additive to the logging behavior above — it never blocks the calling command and never modifies `status.md`.

**Process**:
1. Derive `artifact_id` from the command just logged: strip the `/wire:` prefix and the trailing `-generate`, `-validate`, or `-review` suffix (e.g. `/wire:migration-inventory-generate` → `migration_inventory`). If the command doesn't map to a recognizable artifact (e.g. `/wire:new`, `/wire:status`, `/wire:archive`), skip this check entirely.
2. Read the artifact's own block in `status.md`: `artifacts.<artifact_id>`.
3. Check whether that artifact has already passed its review/approval gate — its `review` field (or equivalent approval field) shows `pass`, `approved`, or `complete`.
4. If the gate has passed, scan every field in the `artifacts.<artifact_id>` block for a value that is still the literal string `TBD`, or an empty list (`[]`) / `null` where the artifact's own template expects a populated value (i.e. the field is not legitimately optional).
5. For each stale field found, emit a one-line warning in the command's output:
   ```
   ⚠ status.md still shows `<field>: TBD` for `<artifact_id>` despite review: pass — status may be stale
   ```
   Emit one warning per stale field — do not suppress after the first.
6. After the last warning (only when at least one was emitted), add one closing line offering the repair path:
   ```
   Run /wire:status-sync <release-folder> to reconcile the record (see specs/utils/status_sync.md).
   ```
   The offer is informational only — never block the calling command and never run the sync automatically.
7. If no stale fields are found, the review/approval gate has not yet passed, or `artifact_id` could not be derived: no output, proceed silently.

This check is self-contained within this utility, so every caller gets it automatically without any caller-side changes.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries, and never
   re-order them. A row is appended at the bottom, always. Rewriting the file
   to insert a row in timestamp order is a modification, not an append.
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
6. **Timestamps must not go backwards.** Because rows are appended in the order
   things happened, each row's timestamp is greater than or equal to the row
   above it. A row whose timestamp precedes its predecessor's means either the
   clock moved or a row was inserted out of order; both are record defects.
   `/wire:status-sync` flags them, naming both rows. This does not block any
   command — the log is written either way, and the flag is a repair prompt.
7. **Single writer in orchestrated mode.** When
   `specs/utils/director_operating_model.md`'s operating model is in force,
   only the orchestrating session appends to this file. Lanes write their own
   state files and the orchestrator writes the log rows from them (rule 6 of
   the operating model). Outside orchestrated mode, every command writes its
   own row as it always has.

## Legacy five-column rows

Logs written before the `By` and `Session` columns existed have four data
columns. They stay valid and are never rewritten:

- A reader parses columns positionally and treats a missing `By` or `Session`
  as unknown. It does not treat a five-column row as malformed and does not
  backfill it.
- The two columns are added on the next write. A file whose header still has
  four columns gets the new header written once, at the point the first
  six-column row is appended; existing rows are left as they are, so a log can
  legitimately hold both shapes.
- Nothing derives meaning from the absence of the columns. An old row is not
  "typed"; it is unknown.
