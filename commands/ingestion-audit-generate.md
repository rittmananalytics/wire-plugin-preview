# Catalog all Fivetran connectors with MCP or CSV fallback

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command
- `specs/<path>.md` references are shared workflow docs shipped with this plugin — read them from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/specs/<path>.md`. If the path matches a Wire command (e.g. `specs/requirements/generate.md`), it means that command (`/wire:requirements-generate`) and its spec is already embedded in the command file.

## Tracing (opt-in, off by default)

---
description: Internal utility — opt-in step-level execution tracing to .wire/releases/<release>/trace.jsonl when WIRE_TRACE=true
---

# Tracing — Detailed, Opt-In, Step-Level Execution Trace

## Purpose

`execution_log.md` records one terse row per whole command (timestamp, command, result, a detail string capped at 120 characters). That's enough for a normal audit trail, but it can't answer "what actually happened inside that command, step by step" — which specific files it read, what it inferred, what it proposed, what a consultant decided, why. Tracing exists for engagements that want that depth: a complete, structured, append-only record of every step of every command, scoped to the release and release type it ran under.

**Off by default.** Tracing never runs unless `WIRE_TRACE=true` is set in the shell environment. If it isn't, skip this entire section — do nothing, check nothing further, proceed straight to the Workflow Specification exactly as if this section didn't exist. This is the common case and must add zero overhead.

## Where it writes

`.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl` — one JSON object per line (JSON Lines), append-only, alongside that release's `status.md` and `execution_log.md`.

For commands not scoped to a specific release (cross-cutting utilities with `release_types: []` in their own front-matter, or any command whose argument isn't a release folder), write to `.wire/trace.jsonl` at the engagement level instead, with `release` and `release_type` fields set to `null`.

This file is **local only** — nothing in it is ever sent anywhere, unlike the anonymous Segment telemetry event described elsewhere. It stays on the consultant's machine, inside the engagement's own repo, exactly like `execution_log.md`.

## What to log, and when

If `WIRE_TRACE=true`:

1. **Resolve context once, before anything else**: the release folder (from this command's own argument, if it has one) and `release_type` (read `.wire/releases/<release_folder>/status.md`'s `project_type` or `release_type` field). If this command has no release-folder argument, both are `null`.
2. **Emit a `command_start` event** before beginning the Workflow Specification below.
3. **As you work through the Workflow Specification's own numbered steps, emit a `step` event after completing each one** — and where a step itself has meaningfully distinct numbered sub-parts (e.g. "check location A, then location B, then infer a match, then propose it"), treat each of those as its own step event too rather than collapsing them into one. The `detail` field has no length limit and is not a summary — write what actually happened: values found, files read, decisions made and why, what was proposed and what the consultant chose. If this step involved the data model registry or any other external/optional resource, log it explicitly: whether it was reached, what was searched, what matched (or didn't, and why not), and whether/how the result was used downstream.
4. **Emit a `command_end` event** when the workflow finishes, with the same `result` value this command would write to `execution_log.md` (`complete`, `pass`, `fail`, `approved`, etc.).

## How to emit an event

Use this pattern for every event (adjust the heredoc body and the Python literals per call — this is a template, not a fixed script):

```bash
[ "${WIRE_TRACE:-false}" = "true" ] && {
  mkdir -p ".wire/releases/<release_folder>" 2>/dev/null
  cat > "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt" << 'WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF'
<the full, untruncated detail text for this event — safe to include quotes,
newlines, code snippets, anything; this heredoc is not shell-interpreted>
WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF
  python3 -c "
import json, datetime
detail = open('/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt').read().rstrip('\n')
event = {
    'ts': datetime.datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'),
    'release': '<release_folder_or_null>',
    'release_type': '<release_type_or_null>',
    'command': 'ingestion-audit-generate',
    'event': '<command_start|step|command_end>',
    'step': '<step_number_or_null>',
    'step_name': '<step_heading_or_null>',
    'result': '<result_value_or_null>',
    'detail': detail,
}
with open('.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl', 'a') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(event) + chr(10))
"
  rm -f "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt"
}
```

- `<release_folder_or_null>` / `<release_type_or_null>`: from Step 1 above; write the literal JSON `null` (no quotes) if either doesn't apply, or a quoted string if it does.
- `event`: `command_start`, `step`, or `command_end`.
- `step` / `step_name`: `null` for `command_start`/`command_end`; the step's own number (e.g. `"1.5"`) and heading (e.g. `"Check for a Canonical Vertical Match"`) for a `step` event.
- `result`: `null` except on `command_end`.
- Adjust the file path in the final `open(...)` call to `.wire/trace.jsonl` for engagement-level (non-release-scoped) commands.

## Rules

1. **Never block or fail the workflow.** If a trace write fails for any reason (disk full, permissions), continue the workflow regardless — trace failures are never surfaced to the user and never stop anything.
2. **Append only** — never rewrite or delete existing lines in `trace.jsonl`.
3. **This is additive to `execution_log.md` and Telemetry, not a replacement for either.** All three continue exactly as documented elsewhere; tracing is a separate, optional, much finer-grained record for engagements that opt in.
4. **Don't summarize into brevity.** The entire point of this mechanism over `execution_log.md` is that it isn't limited to a 120-character line — write the real detail.

## Automatic Validation (on by default)

---
description: Internal utility — injected auto-validate section so generate commands run their matching validate step automatically and fold the result into their output
---

Every `generate` command that has a matching `validate` command for the
same artifact runs that validate step automatically as part of generate —
by default, with no separate command to remember. This section only appears
on commands where that applies; artifacts with no separate validate step at
all (e.g. mockups, workshops, UAT) never carry this section.

## Step: Check `auto_validate`

Read this command's own `auto_validate` front-matter field, in the Workflow
Specification below. Two states:

- **Absent, or `true`** (the default — most artifacts): auto-validate runs.
- **`false`**: this artifact's validate step is expensive — it runs real
  code, queries a live warehouse or BI tool, or otherwise does IO beyond
  re-reading local files — so it does not run automatically. Skip to
  "If `auto_validate: false`" below.

## If `auto_validate` is absent or `true`: run validate automatically

Once this command finishes writing its artifact, before ending:

1. Run this artifact's own `/wire:<artifact-with-dashes>-validate` workflow
   in full, exactly as if the consultant had typed it themselves — same
   inputs, same `status.md` write to `artifacts.<artifact>.validate`, same
   report. This is not optional or an extra step layered on top; it is the
   default behavior for this artifact.
2. Fold the result into this command's own closing output rather than
   presenting it as a separate command run:
   - **PASS** — add a single closing line: `✅ Auto-validated — PASS`. The
     full report already went to `status.md`/`execution_log.md`, exactly as
     it would from a standalone validate run — no need to repeat it here.
   - **FAIL** — surface the validate command's own failure report in full,
     exactly as running validate standalone would show it, so the
     consultant sees what's wrong immediately without running anything
     else themselves.
3. This never blocks or undoes generate itself — the artifact is written
   either way, and its content is never rolled back because validate
   failed. Auto-validation only means validate has already run and its
   result is already on record by the time generate finishes, instead of
   waiting for the consultant to remember to run it separately.

## If `auto_validate` is `false`: state this plainly, don't run it

Do not run validate. End with a line naming why, as specifically as this
spec's own context makes possible (e.g. "runs `dbt run`/`dbt test`",
"queries the live target warehouse", "calls the Looker API directly") —
fall back to "performs live checks against an external system" only if no
more specific reason is evident from context:

```
⚠ This artifact's validate step [reason] and does not run automatically.
Run /wire:<artifact-with-dashes>-validate <release_folder> before
requesting review — review is blocked until it passes.
```

## Why this is always safe either way

`review` already requires `validate: PASS` for this same artifact as one of
its own declared preconditions (see `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md`) —
this is existing, independent enforcement, not something added by this
section. So an `auto_validate: false` opt-out never lets an artifact reach
review unvalidated; it only decides *when* the consultant pays validate's
cost — automatically on every draft (the default), or once, on their own
schedule, before requesting review (the opt-out). Auto-validation is a
convenience that closes the "forgot to run it" gap for the common case; the
gate that actually prevents unvalidated work from being reviewed was already
there.

# Ingestion Audit — Generate

## Purpose

Catalogs every active ingestion source on the platform being migrated, capturing source type, destination schema, sync frequency, row volumes, and a migration readiness flag. The output is the primary input to the migration inventory and determines which sources need new destinations configured on the target platform.

Supports eight ingestion tool branches; each follows the same output shape but uses the tool's own concepts:

| `migration.ingestion_tool` value | Concept mapping | Skill |
|---|---|---|
| `fivetran` (default) | Connector → destination schema → tables | `fivetran` |
| `rudderstack` | Source → tracking plan → destinations | `rudderstack` |
| `coupler-io` | Dataflow (source integration + destination + schedule) | `coupler-io` |
| `segment` | Source → tracking plan → connected destinations | `segment` |
| `airbyte` | Workspace → source / destination / connection / sync (Airbyte API; Agent MCP optional) | `airbyte` |
| `kleene` | Connection (marketing/e-commerce source → destination + schedule) | n/a |
| `funnel` | Connector (ad-platform source → data destination + schedule) | n/a |
| `amplitude` | Export / data destination (event source → warehouse-bound export) | n/a |
| `other` | Connector → destination (CSV import only) | n/a |

**Coverage note**: every ingestion tool actually in use on the source platform must have a branch here — a source that isn't cataloged is invisible to migration planning, and any dbt models or dashboards that depend on it cannot pass equivalency testing (see `wire/specs/migration/equivalency/investigate.md` and `wire/specs/migration/equivalency/validate.md`) because their upstream data was never brought into scope. Whenever a new ingestion source is added to this audit (including a first-time run of one of the branches below), re-run `/wire:migration-inventory-generate $ARGUMENTS` afterwards so the dependency graph and effort estimate pick it up — the inventory does not auto-refresh from a re-run of this audit alone.

## Prerequisites

- Release folder with `release_type: platform_migration` in `status.md`
- Source platform confirmed in `status.md` under `migration.source_platform`
- Ingestion tool confirmed in `status.md` under `migration.ingestion_tool` (defaults to `fivetran` if absent)
- Per-tool access — one of:
  - **Fivetran**: MCP server or pre-exported `audit/fivetran_connectors_input.csv`
  - **RudderStack**: MCP server (`rudderstack` in `.claude/settings.json`, OAuth)
  - **Coupler.io**: MCP server (`coupler-io` in `.claude/settings.json`, personal access token)
  - **Segment**: Public API token (`SEGMENT_TOKEN` env var) — no MCP server available
  - **Airbyte**: Airbyte API token (`AIRBYTE_TOKEN` env var pointing at `api.airbyte.com/v1` or self-hosted endpoint). The Agent MCP at `mcp.airbyte.ai/mcp` is also available but designed for agent-driven data fetching rather than deployment inspection
  - **Kleene**: no MCP server exists in Wire's catalog today — API token (`KLEENE_API_TOKEN`) if the client has one, otherwise CSV import at `audit/kleene_connections_input.csv`
  - **Funnel**: no MCP server exists in Wire's catalog today — API token (`FUNNEL_API_TOKEN`) if the client has one, otherwise CSV import at `audit/funnel_connectors_input.csv`
  - **Amplitude**: the `amplitude` MCP server (`https://mcp.amplitude.com/mcp`) is configured in `.claude/settings.json`, but its tools are scoped to product analytics (charts, dashboards, experiments, taxonomy) and do not expose warehouse-export/destination inventory — treat it as unavailable for this audit. Use the Amplitude Export/Data Destinations API (`AMPLITUDE_API_KEY` / `AMPLITUDE_SECRET_KEY`) if configured, otherwise CSV import at `audit/amplitude_exports_input.csv`
  - **Other** (Stitch, Estuary, custom): CSV import only at `audit/ingestion_sources_input.csv`

## Inputs

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/status.md` — source platform, ingestion tool, connectivity mode
- Tool-specific data source (MCP / API / CSV — see Step 2 branches)
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/fivetran_column_selections.csv` (Fivetran only, optional — column-level include/exclude rules)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Locate the release and ingestion tool

1. Resolve `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/`. Confirm `status.md` has `release_type: platform_migration`. If not, stop — "This command only applies to platform_migration releases."
2. Read `migration.source_platform`, `migration.ingestion_tool`, and `migration.connectivity` from `status.md`. If `ingestion_tool` is absent, default to `fivetran` and note this in the audit output.
3. If the audit file already exists at `audit/ingestion_audit.md`, ask whether to re-generate (overwrite) or update (append new sources only).

### Step 2: Branch on ingestion_tool

#### Step 2a — `fivetran` (default)

Attempt to reach the Fivetran MCP server. Set a 10-second timeout.

**If Fivetran MCP responds**:
- Call `fivetran:list_connectors` to retrieve all connectors for the account
- Call `fivetran:get_connector_schema` for each connector to capture destination schema and table list
- Call `fivetran:get_connector_sync_status` for recent sync history and row volume estimates
- Proceed to Step 3 with MCP-sourced data

**If Fivetran MCP times out or is unavailable**:
- Check for `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/fivetran_connectors_input.csv`
- If CSV exists, read it and proceed to Step 3 with CSV-sourced data
- If CSV does not exist, output the following instructions and stop:

```
Fivetran MCP is not available and no input CSV was found.

To proceed, export your Fivetran connector list to CSV and save it at:
  .wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/fivetran_connectors_input.csv

Required CSV columns (see TEMPLATES/migration/fivetran_connectors_input.csv for the template):
  connector_id, connector_name, service_type, destination_schema, destination_table_prefix,
  sync_frequency_minutes, status, row_count_estimate, last_synced_at, include_in_migration,
  migration_notes

Then re-run: /wire:ingestion-audit-generate $ARGUMENTS
```

#### Step 2b — `rudderstack`

Attempt to reach the RudderStack MCP server at `mcp.rudderstack.com`. Activate the `rudderstack` skill for full details on the tool surface.

**If RudderStack MCP responds**:
- List all sources (web SDK / iOS / Android / server / cloud sources)
- For each source: capture type, tracking plan ID, library version, and connected destinations
- List all destinations (warehouse / marketing / analytics)
- For each destination: capture type, settings (names only, no secrets), and source filter rules
- List all tracking plans and the sources using each plan
- Proceed to Step 3 with MCP-sourced data; concept mapping: source→connector, destination_schema→tracking_plan, destination_table_prefix→connected_destinations

**If RudderStack MCP unavailable**: ask the user to authenticate via `/mcp auth rudderstack` (OAuth browser flow). If still unavailable, stop with instructions to run `npx -y mcp-remote https://mcp.rudderstack.com/mcp` manually.

#### Step 2c — `coupler-io`

Attempt to reach the Coupler.io MCP server at `app.coupler.io/mcp`. Activate the `coupler-io` skill for full details.

**If Coupler MCP responds**:
- Call `list-dataflows` to enumerate every dataflow in the workspace
- Per dataflow: capture source integration + credential, destination, schedule, and the dataset shape it produces (`get-dataflow`, `get-schema`)
- Classify each dataflow as ingestion (SaaS → warehouse) or reverse-ETL (warehouse → SaaS / BI). Both directions are in scope for the migration; reverse-ETL has different cutover risk.
- Proceed to Step 3 with MCP-sourced data; concept mapping: dataflow→connector, destination→destination_schema, dataset→destination_table_prefix

**If Coupler MCP unavailable**: ask the user to add the personal access token via `/mcp auth coupler-io`. If still unavailable, fall back to CSV import at `audit/coupler_dataflows_input.csv`.

#### Step 2d — `segment`

Segment has no MCP server; this branch uses the Segment Public API directly. Activate the `segment` skill for full details on auth and endpoints.

**Prerequisite**: `SEGMENT_TOKEN` env var set, and `SEGMENT_BASE` set to either `https://api.segmentapis.com` (US) or `https://eu1.api.segmentapis.com` (EU).

**Steps**:
- `GET /sources` — list all sources
- `GET /sources/{id}` — per source: type (analytics.js / iOS / Android / server / cloud), library version, tracking plan
- `GET /sources/{id}/connected-destinations` — per source: connected destinations
- `GET /destinations` and `GET /destinations/{id}` — destination inventory
- `GET /tracking-plans` and `GET /tracking-plans/{id}` — tracking plan schemas
- Proceed to Step 3 with API-sourced data; concept mapping: source→connector, destination_schema→tracking_plan, destination_table_prefix→connected_destinations

**Note**: most Segment migrations target RudderStack as the replacement CDP. The audit output should include a destination-by-destination "RudderStack equivalent" column where applicable.

**If `SEGMENT_TOKEN` is not set**: stop and output:
```
Set SEGMENT_TOKEN to a Public API token from your Segment workspace
(Settings → Access Management → Tokens). For EU workspaces, also set
SEGMENT_BASE=https://eu1.api.segmentapis.com. Then re-run.
```

#### Step 2e — `airbyte`

Use the Airbyte API directly (preferred for deployment inspection — the Agent MCP at `mcp.airbyte.ai/mcp` is designed for agent-driven data fetching, not workspace management). Activate the `airbyte` skill for full details.

**Prerequisite**: `AIRBYTE_TOKEN` env var set, `AIRBYTE_BASE` set to `https://api.airbyte.com/v1` (Airbyte Cloud) or the customer's self-hosted endpoint.

**Steps**:
- `GET /workspaces` — enumerate workspaces
- `GET /workspaces/{id}/sources` — per workspace: list sources (connector type + configuration without secrets)
- `GET /workspaces/{id}/destinations` — list destinations (warehouse destinations usually in scope)
- `GET /connections?workspaceId={id}` — source-to-destination mappings, sync mode, schedule, stream selection
- `GET /jobs?connectionId={id}&limit=10` — recent sync history + row volume estimates

Concept mapping: source→connector, connection→connector relationship, destination→destination_schema, connection prefix→destination_table_prefix, sync mode→migration_notes. See `wire/skills/airbyte/SKILL.md` for the full field-by-field mapping.

**If `AIRBYTE_TOKEN` is not set**: stop and output:
```
Set AIRBYTE_TOKEN to an API key from your Airbyte deployment
(Cloud: Settings → API Keys; self-hosted: per your auth integration).
Also set AIRBYTE_BASE to https://api.airbyte.com/v1 or your endpoint.
Then re-run.
```

#### Step 2f — `other` (Stitch, Estuary, custom)

CSV import only. Ask the user to export the source list to `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/ingestion_sources_input.csv` with columns:
`source_id, source_name, source_type, destination_schema, destination_table_prefix, sync_frequency_minutes, status, row_count_estimate, last_synced_at, include_in_migration, migration_notes`.

#### Step 2g — `kleene`

Kleene.ai (ELT for marketing/e-commerce data into a warehouse). **No MCP server for Kleene exists in Wire's catalog today** (`wire/specs/mcp.md`) — this branch is fallback-path only until one is added.

**If a `kleene` MCP server is later added to `.claude/settings.json`**: prefer it, following the same list-connections / get-connection-schema pattern used for Coupler.io in Step 2c.

**API/manual fallback (the practical path today)**: if `KLEENE_API_TOKEN` is set, use the Kleene REST API to enumerate connections (source integration, destination, schedule) and per-connection sync history. Confirm current endpoint paths against Kleene's own API documentation — none are hardcoded here.

**If no API token**: fall back to CSV import at `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/kleene_connections_input.csv` with columns:
`connection_id, connection_name, source_type, destination_schema, destination_table_prefix, sync_frequency_minutes, status, row_count_estimate, last_synced_at, include_in_migration, migration_notes`.

Concept mapping: connection→connector, destination→destination_schema, dataset→destination_table_prefix.

#### Step 2h — `funnel`

Funnel.io (consolidates ad-platform and marketing data into a warehouse or BI destination). **No MCP server for Funnel exists in Wire's catalog today** — this branch is fallback-path only until one is added.

**If a `funnel` MCP server is later added**: prefer it, following the same pattern as Step 2c/2g.

**API/manual fallback (the practical path today)**: if `FUNNEL_API_TOKEN` is set, use the Funnel API to list connectors and data destinations, and their schedules. Confirm current endpoint paths against Funnel's own API documentation — none are hardcoded here.

**If no API token**: fall back to CSV import at `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/funnel_connectors_input.csv` with columns:
`connector_id, connector_name, source_type, destination_schema, destination_table_prefix, sync_frequency_minutes, status, row_count_estimate, last_synced_at, include_in_migration, migration_notes`.

Concept mapping: connector→connector, data destination→destination_schema, dataset→destination_table_prefix.

#### Step 2i — `amplitude`

Amplitude as a data source syncing event data into the warehouse (via Amplitude's Export API / Data Destinations feature — distinct from Amplitude as a product-analytics tool). **The `amplitude` MCP server is configured in Wire's catalog (`https://mcp.amplitude.com/mcp`)**, but its documented tool surface is scoped to product analytics — charts, dashboards, experiments, session replay, instrumentation, taxonomy — not to enumerating warehouse-bound exports or destinations. Do not assume it exposes connector/sync inventory; treat it as unavailable for this audit unless/until it ships an Export or Data Destinations tool.

**API/manual fallback (the practical path today)**: if `AMPLITUDE_API_KEY` and `AMPLITUDE_SECRET_KEY` are set, use the Amplitude Export API / Data Destinations API to enumerate warehouse-bound exports (destination schema, table prefix, sync cadence). Confirm current endpoint paths against Amplitude's own API documentation — none are hardcoded here.

**If no API access**: fall back to CSV import at `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/amplitude_exports_input.csv` with columns:
`export_id, export_name, source_type, destination_schema, destination_table_prefix, sync_frequency_minutes, status, row_count_estimate, last_synced_at, include_in_migration, migration_notes`.

Concept mapping: export→connector, data destination→destination_schema, dataset→destination_table_prefix.

### Step 3: Build the connector catalog

For each connector, capture:

| Field | Source (MCP) | Source (CSV) |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `connector_id` | MCP response | CSV column |
| `connector_name` | MCP response | CSV column |
| `service_type` | MCP response | CSV column |
| `destination_schema` | MCP schema call | CSV column |
| `destination_table_prefix` | MCP schema call | CSV column |
| `sync_frequency_minutes` | MCP status | CSV column |
| `status` | MCP status | CSV column |
| `row_count_estimate` | MCP status (last sync rows) | CSV column |
| `last_synced_at` | MCP status | CSV column |
| `include_in_migration` | Derive from status (broken/paused → review) | CSV column |
| `migration_notes` | Auto-generated based on service type | CSV column |

Apply column-level selection rules from `fivetran_column_selections.csv` if present — flag any connectors that have column exclusions, as these require manual review during migration.

### Step 4: Classify migration complexity per connector

Assign each connector a complexity rating:

- **Low**: Standard SaaS source (Salesforce, HubSpot, Stripe, Google Analytics) with no column exclusions and active sync status
- **Medium**: Custom connector, paused connector, large row volumes (>100M rows), or column exclusions present
- **High**: Broken connector, unsupported service type on target platform, or schema conflicts with existing target objects

### Step 5: Write the audit report

**Output location**: `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/ingestion_audit.md`

Use the template at `TEMPLATES/migration/ingestion_audit.md`. Populate:
- Summary table of all connectors with fields from Step 3 and complexity rating from Step 4
- By-service-type breakdown (e.g., 12 Salesforce connectors, 3 custom, 1 broken)
- Migration flags: connectors marked `include_in_migration: false` listed separately with reason
- Column exclusions section if any apply
- Recommended migration order (Low complexity first, High last)

### Step 6: Update status

```yaml
artifacts:
  ingestion_audit:
    generate: complete
    file: audit/ingestion_audit.md
    generated_date: "{{TODAY}}"
    connector_count: N
    data_source: "fivetran_mcp" | "csv"
```

### Step 7: Output summary

Print: total connectors cataloged, breakdown by complexity, count flagged for exclusion, data source used (MCP or CSV), and next command:

```
/wire:ingestion-audit-validate $ARGUMENTS
```

## Output Files

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/audit/ingestion_audit.md`
- Updated `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/status.md`


## Post-Execution Hooks

After updating `status.md`, run these in sequence:

1. **Execution log** — Append one row to `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/execution_log.md` following `specs/utils/execution_log.md`.

2. **Jira sync** — Follow `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `ingestion_audit` as artifact, `generate` as action.

3. **Document store** — Follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `ingestion_audit` as artifact_id, `Ingestion Audit` as artifact_name, and the `file` value from `artifacts.ingestion_audit` in status.md as file_path.

4. **Auto-commit** — Follow `specs/utils/commit.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as release_folder, `ingestion_audit` as artifact, `generate` as action.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

---
description: Internal utility — appends a log entry to the project's execution log after any generate/validate/review workflow or skill activation
---

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Stale Status Check

Immediately after appending a **command** row (this does not apply to skill activation entries), perform a quick freshness check against the project's `status.md`. This is additive to the logging behavior above — it never blocks the calling command and never modifies `status.md`.

**Process**:
1. Derive `artifact_id` from the command just logged: strip the `/wire:` prefix and the trailing `-generate`, `-validate`, or `-review` suffix (e.g. `/wire:migration-inventory-generate` → `migration_inventory`). If the command doesn't map to a recognizable artifact (e.g. `/wire:new`, `/wire:status`, `/wire:archive`), skip this check entirely.
2. Read the artifact's own block in `status.md`: `artifacts.<artifact_id>`.
3. Check whether that artifact has already passed its review/approval gate — its `review` field (or equivalent approval field) shows `pass`, `approved`, or `complete`.
4. If the gate has passed, scan every field in the `artifacts.<artifact_id>` block for a value that is still the literal string `TBD`, or an empty list (`[]`) / `null` where the artifact's own template expects a populated value (i.e. the field is not legitimately optional).
5. For each stale field found, emit a one-line warning in the command's output:
   ```
   ⚠ status.md still shows `<field>: TBD` for `<artifact_id>` despite review: pass — status may be stale
   ```
   Emit one warning per stale field — do not suppress after the first.
6. After the last warning (only when at least one was emitted), add one closing line offering the repair path:
   ```
   Run /wire:status-sync <release-folder> to reconcile the record (see specs/utils/status_sync.md).
   ```
   The offer is informational only — never block the calling command and never run the sync automatically.
7. If no stale fields are found, the review/approval gate has not yet passed, or `artifact_id` could not be derived: no output, proceed silently.

This check is self-contained within this utility, so every caller gets it automatically without any caller-side changes.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
