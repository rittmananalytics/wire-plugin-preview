description: Internal utility — appends a log entry to the project's execution log after any generate/validate/review workflow or skill activation

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail | By | Session | Duration | Tokens | Cost (USD) |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|----|---------|----------|--------|------------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> | <by> | <session> | <duration> | n/a | n/a |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition, or an advisory gate satisfied by a director's ruling
  - `mode` — the director handed control over or took it back ("you drive" / "I'll drive"), per `specs/utils/director_operating_model.md`
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason
  - For a ruling-satisfied advisory gate: the precondition and the ruling id
- **By**: the git user (`git config user.name`), or `unknown` if git has no
  user configured. Who the run is attributable to, regardless of what typed it.
- **Session**: what invoked the run. One of:
  - `typed` — a person typed the command
  - `orchestrator` — the orchestrating session dispatched it, followed by its
    session id in brackets where one is available: `orchestrator [a1b2c3]`
  - a lane label — the lane that ran it, e.g. `dbt-developer [staging 1/2]`
  - `autopilot` — `/wire:autopilot` ran it

  This is the same value the `invoked_by` telemetry property carries
  (`specs/utils/telemetry.md`), read from `WIRE_INVOKED_BY` and defaulting to
  `typed`. The log records it per row so the record on disk answers the same
  question telemetry answers in aggregate.
- **Duration**: Wall-clock time the workflow took. As the first action of the
  workflow, run `date +%s` and note the value as the start time. When
  appending the log row, run `date +%s` again and format the difference as
  `42s`, `4m 12s`, or `1h 03m`. If the start time was not captured, write
  `n/a`. Skill activation entries write `n/a`.
- **Tokens**: Total model tokens the run consumed (input + output, including
  cache reads and writes). Write the literal `n/a` — a model cannot measure
  its own token usage, and an estimated figure must never be written. On
  Claude Code, the Wire plugin's metrics hook backfills this cell with the
  measured value from the session transcript after the turn ends (see
  Metrics Backfill below). On runtimes without the hook (e.g. Gemini CLI)
  the cell stays `n/a`.
- **Cost (USD)**: Estimated cost of the measured tokens, e.g. `$0.42`. Same
  rule as Tokens: write `n/a`; the metrics hook backfills it where token
  usage can be measured. Never compute or guess this yourself.

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column, with `n/a` in all three metric columns:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> | <by> | <session> | n/a | n/a | n/a |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Stale Status Check

Immediately after appending a **command** row (this does not apply to skill activation entries), perform a quick freshness check against the project's `status.md`. This is additive to the logging behavior above — it never blocks the calling command and never modifies `status.md`.

**Process**:
1. Derive `artifact_id` from the command just logged: strip the `/wire:` prefix and the trailing `-generate`, `-validate`, or `-review` suffix (e.g. `/wire:migration-inventory-generate` → `migration_inventory`). If the command doesn't map to a recognizable artifact (e.g. `/wire:new`, `/wire:status`, `/wire:archive`), skip this check entirely.
2. Read the artifact's own block in `status.md`: `artifacts.<artifact_id>`.
3. Check whether that artifact has already passed its review/approval gate — its `review` field (or equivalent approval field) shows `pass`, `approved`, or `complete`.
4. If the gate has passed, scan every field in the `artifacts.<artifact_id>` block for a value that is still the literal string `TBD`, or an empty list (`[]`) / `null` where the artifact's own template expects a populated value (i.e. the field is not legitimately optional).
5. For each stale field found, emit a one-line warning in the command's output:
   ```
   ⚠ status.md still shows `<field>: TBD` for `<artifact_id>` despite review: pass — status may be stale
   ```
   Emit one warning per stale field — do not suppress after the first.
6. After the last warning (only when at least one was emitted), add one closing line offering the repair path:
   ```
   Run /wire:status-sync <release-folder> to reconcile the record (see specs/utils/status_sync.md).
   ```
   The offer is informational only — never block the calling command and never run the sync automatically.
7. If no stale fields are found, the review/approval gate has not yet passed, or `artifact_id` could not be derived: no output, proceed silently.

This check is self-contained within this utility, so every caller gets it automatically without any caller-side changes.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries, and never
   re-order them. A row is appended at the bottom, always. Rewriting the file
   to insert a row in timestamp order is a modification, not an append. One
   exception: the metrics hook (see Metrics Backfill below) may rewrite the
   Duration, Tokens, and Cost cells of the most recent row, and nothing else.
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
6. **Timestamps must not go backwards.** Because rows are appended in the order
   things happened, each row's timestamp is greater than or equal to the row
   above it. A row whose timestamp precedes its predecessor's means either the
   clock moved or a row was inserted out of order; both are record defects.
   `/wire:status-sync` flags them, naming both rows. This does not block any
   command — the log is written either way, and the flag is a repair prompt.
7. **Single writer in orchestrated mode.** When
   `specs/utils/director_operating_model.md`'s operating model is in force,
   only the orchestrating session appends to this file. Lanes write their own
   state files and the orchestrator writes the log rows from them (rule 6 of
   the operating model). Outside orchestrated mode, every command writes its
   own row as it always has.
8. **Never fabricate metrics.** Tokens and Cost are written as `n/a` and only
   ever filled by tooling that measured them. A best guess is worse than
   `n/a` in a client-facing audit trail.

## Metrics Backfill (Claude Code)

The Wire Claude Code plugin registers a `Stop` hook (`hooks/wire-metrics.sh`)
that runs after each turn ends. It reads the session transcript, sums the
measured token usage from the most recent `/wire:*` command invocation to the
end of the turn, estimates its cost from a built-in price table, and rewrites
the Duration (only if still `n/a`), Tokens, and Cost cells of the log's most
recent row — only when that row's Command matches the command found in the
transcript and the row already has the metric columns. It never touches any
other cell or row. Commands that span several turns (e.g. a review waiting on
feedback) are re-summed on each turn's hook run, so the final backfill covers
the whole command. If the cost table does not recognise the model, Tokens is
still filled and Cost stays `n/a`. On runtimes without this hook, the metric
cells keep the values the workflow wrote.

## Legacy five-column rows

Logs written before the `By` and `Session` columns existed have four data
columns, and logs written before the `Duration`, `Tokens`, and `Cost (USD)`
columns existed have four or six. They stay valid and are never rewritten:

- A reader parses columns positionally and treats a missing `By`, `Session`,
  or metric column as unknown. It does not treat a shorter row as malformed
  and does not backfill it.
- Missing columns are added on the next write. A file whose header still has
  the older shape gets the new header written once, at the point the first
  nine-column row is appended; existing rows are left as they are, so a log
  can legitimately hold several shapes.
- Nothing derives meaning from the absence of the columns. An old row is not
  "typed"; it is unknown. A row without metric cells is unmeasured, not free
  or instant — and the metrics hook skips rows that lack the metric columns.
