# Wire Framework Tutorials

The release-type reference pages tell you which artifacts a release produces and in what order, but they cannot show you what a release feels like on the day: what the command output looks like, when a specialist agent takes a task off your hands, which of the MCP integrations wakes up at a given gate and, above all, why a consultant chose one path over another when the reference offered two. Wouldn't it be useful to watch each release type run from start to finish on an engagement that resembles your own before you run it for real?

That is what these tutorials are for. Each one is a scenario-based walkthrough of a single Wire release type, built around a fictional client engagement, and each goes further than the reference page by showing realistic command output, how agent delegation plays out in practice, which MCP integrations activate at each gate and the decision-making context that shapes what gets generated. The scenarios have been constructed to surface the parts of each release type that are easy to misread from the reference alone, such as "appetite" versus scope in a Shape Up discovery, the "two-zone" safety model in a platform migration and the seed-based prototyping sequence in a Dashboard First release.

The supplementary tutorials at the bottom of the table cover the operational mechanics rather than a release type: installing and upgrading the plugin, joining an active engagement mid-stream and upgrading an existing release folder when a newer version of Wire is installed. As such, we suggest you read the tutorial for your release type before running `/wire:new`, or keep it open alongside the terminal during delivery, and turn to the supplementary tutorials when something about the environment or the engagement handover is non-standard.

## A note on typed commands

Every tutorial below shows the commands being typed, because that is the
clearest way to show what runs and in what order. **Since v4.0.0, on Claude
Code, you do not have to type them.** You say what you want done, and Wire works
out which command that is from the release-type definition, runs it, tells you what
it did and stops where a decision is yours.

It follows, therefore, that you should read the tutorials as "what Wire will run"
rather than "what you must type", since the commands, the artifacts and the record
on disk are identical either way. See
[The Release Director Model](../advanced/release-director), and the
[Dashboard First](./dashboard-first) tutorial for the same release driven by
direction rather than by keystrokes.

:::note

The original worked example at [Advanced → Worked Example](../advanced/worked-example) uses a real RA client engagement (Barton Peveril Sixth Form College), whereas the tutorials on this page use fictional scenarios designed to illustrate each release type.
