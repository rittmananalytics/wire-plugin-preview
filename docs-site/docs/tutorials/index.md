# Wire Framework Tutorials

These tutorials are scenario-based walkthroughs of each Wire release type, built around fictional client engagements. They go further than the release-type reference pages: each one shows realistic command output, how agent delegation plays out in practice, which MCP integrations activate at each gate, and the decision-making context that shapes what gets generated. The scenarios are constructed to surface the parts of each release type that are easy to misread from the reference alone — appetite versus scope in a Shape Up discovery, the two-zone safety model in a platform migration, the seed-based prototyping sequence in a Dashboard First release.

The supplementary tutorials at the bottom of the table cover the operational mechanics: installing and upgrading the plugin, joining an active engagement mid-stream, and upgrading an existing release folder when a newer version of Wire is installed. Read the tutorial for your release type before running `/wire:new`, or keep it open alongside the terminal during delivery. The supplementary tutorials are most useful when something about the environment or the engagement handover is non-standard.

:::note

The original worked example at [Advanced → Worked Example](../advanced/worked-example) uses a real RA client engagement (Barton Peveril Sixth Form College). These tutorials use fictional scenarios specifically designed to illustrate each release type.
