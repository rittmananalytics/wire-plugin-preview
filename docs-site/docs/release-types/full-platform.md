:::info[Tutorial available]

A worked example of a Full Platform engagement — using a fictional client scenario with realistic command output, agent delegation, and reviewer decisions — is available in the [Tutorial: Full Platform](../tutorials/full-platform).

:::


## Phase 1: Requirements (Day 1)

After `/wire:new` completes, copy the SOW PDF and any source materials into the release's `requirements/` directory. Ensure `engagement/sow.md` and `engagement/context.md` are populated.

`/wire:requirements-generate` reads the SOW and engagement context, extracts structured requirements (functional, non-functional, data, technical, user), maps each SOW deliverable to the framework artifacts that will produce it, and writes `requirements/requirements_specification.md`.

**Ready criteria**: requirements artifact is `review: approved`.

## Phase 2: Design (Days 2–4)

The design phase follows a defined sequence. The conceptual model gates everything else.

### Step 1: Conceptual entity model

`/wire:conceptual_model-generate` produces a business-level entity model: an inventory of domain entities, a Mermaid `erDiagram` (entity names and relationships, no columns), and a relationship narrative.

> **Review audience: business stakeholders, not just the technical team.** Approving entities here constrains everything that follows.

### Step 2: Pipeline design + data flow diagram

`/wire:pipeline_design-generate` produces the full pipeline architecture document — source system analysis, replication scenarios with cost analysis, scheduling, error handling, design decisions requiring client input — **plus an embedded Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**.

### Step 3: Logical model (optional)

`/wire:logical_model-generate` sits between the conceptual and the physical model, and holds the decisions that are neither business nor dbt: what the primary key of an entity actually is, whether a relationship is one-to-many or many-to-many, which source wins when the same customer exists in three systems, how far to normalise, and how a conversion is attributed.

Those decisions were previously made implicitly inside `data_model-generate`, which meant they arrived already expressed as dbt models and were hard to review as decisions. Optional here, and worth running when identity resolution or attribution is contested.

Where the client already models in Modality, this command reads the existing `.mml` rather than restating it. See [Modality models as an input](../advanced/modality-models.md).

### Step 4: Data model specification + physical ERD

`/wire:data_model-generate` produces the complete dbt-layer data model specification — source definitions, staging models, integration models, warehouse models with surrogate keys and FK paths, seed files — **plus an embedded Physical ERD**.

> **This is the most important review gate in the full-platform workflow.** Approving a model with incorrect grain, wrong join keys, or missing entities is expensive to fix after dbt code is generated.

### Step 5: Dashboard mockups

`/wire:mockups-generate` produces dashboard wireframes. Review with end users, not the technical stakeholder.

**Ready criteria**: every required design artifact is `review: approved`. `logical_model` is optional and reported as not applicable when it has not been run.


## Business rules discovery (optional first phase)

New in 4.0. `/wire:business-rules-generate` runs before design and establishes what
the numbers mean, one business domain at a time.

It reads the definitions that already exist — in dbt, in LookML, and through
`--import` from systems Wire cannot read such as SAP BW, Hana or SAC — then asks
the people who own the numbers to settle the ones that disagree. The output is a
register: one entry per rule, holding every competing definition with the file it
came from, what they disagree on, the decision, the named approver, and a
reconciliation query that runs at generate time rather than in QA.

A rule nobody has decided is recorded with status `unknown`, which passes
validate. That is the point of it: a register has to be able to say "nobody has
agreed whether in-store orders are in this figure", because that sentence is what
stops the number being wrong nine months later.

**The gate is advisory.** ``conceptual_model-generate`` warns when the register has not been
reviewed, asks for a one-line reason, records it as an `advisory_skip`, and
proceeds. Skipping is a real choice; what matters is that the choice is visible.

## Phase 3: Development (Days 5–8)

`/wire:dbt-generate` generates all dbt models from the approved data model specification. The generation embeds comprehensive analytics engineering conventions: field naming rules (`_pk`, `_fk`, `_ts`, `is_`/`has_` prefixes), field ordering, SQL style rules, and multi-source framework support. Includes YAML documentation files and automated tests (not_null + unique on every PK, relationships on every FK — typically 40–50 tests for a mid-sized engagement).

`/wire:orchestration-generate` prompts you to choose between **Dagster** (Python-native, assets-first) and **dbt Cloud** (managed scheduling).

`/wire:semantic_layer-generate` generates LookML views, explores, measures, and dimension definitions from the approved dbt models.

**Ready criteria**: all four development artifacts are `review: approved` and dbt tests passing.

## Phase 4: Testing (Days 9–10)

`/wire:data_quality-generate` generates additional data quality tests beyond the embedded dbt tests: freshness checks, row count reconciliation, cross-system validation, custom business rules.

`/wire:uat-generate` generates a UAT plan mapped to the functional requirements. Do not proceed to deployment without UAT sign-off.

## Phase 5: Deployment (Day 11)

`/wire:deployment-generate` generates the deployment runbook, CI/CD pipeline configuration, monitoring and alerting setup, and rollback procedures.

## Phase 6: Enablement (Days 12–13)

`/wire:training-generate` generates two training packages:
- **Data team enablement**: technical session plan (2 hours)
- **End user training**: dashboard usage session (90 minutes)

## Utility commands available at any phase

- **`/wire:utils-run-dbt`** — Runs the generated dbt models in dbt Cloud or locally
- **`/wire:utils-deploy-to-dev`** — Deploys to the development environment
- **`/wire:utils-deploy-to-prod`** — Deploys to the production environment
- **`/wire:utils-meeting-context`** — Retrieves Fathom meeting transcripts for context
- **`/wire:utils-jira-sync`** — Syncs artifact status to Jira issues
- **`/wire:utils-atlassian-search`** — Searches Confluence for documentation

> **Tip**: Run `/wire:playbook-generate <release-folder>` after requirements are approved to get a visual end-to-end plan for this release.
