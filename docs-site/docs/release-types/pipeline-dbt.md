# Pipeline + dbt Release

:::tip[You do not have to type these commands]

Since v4.0.0, on Claude Code, you can direct this release in plain language
instead: say what you want done and Wire works out which command that is from
this release type's definition, names it before it runs, runs it, and stops at
every review gate for your decision. The commands, the artifacts and the record
on disk are identical either way, and typing them still works. See
[The Release Director Model](../advanced/release-director).

:::


Use this when a new data source needs connecting through to the dbt layer, but a BI tool / semantic layer is already in place or out of scope.

**In-scope artifacts**: `requirements`, `pipeline_design`, `data_model`, `pipeline`, `dbt`, `data_quality`, `deployment`

**Out of scope**: `mockups`, `semantic_layer`, `dashboards`, `uat`, `training`, `documentation`

## Choosing a pipeline replication tool

`/wire:pipeline_design-generate` includes a **pipeline tool selection step**. The framework supports three managed tools plus a custom option:

| Tool | Best for | Cost model | Infrastructure |
|------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Fivetran** | SaaS sources, managed CDC, minimal engineering | MAR-based | Fully managed |
| **dlt** | Python-native teams, cost-sensitive, custom APIs | Open-source | Scripts + dlt Cloud |
| **Airbyte** | Mixed sources, open-source preference | Open-source / Cloud | Self-hosted or Airbyte Cloud |
| **Custom** | Highly specialised sources, full control | Engineering time | Self-managed |

The chosen tool is recorded as `pipeline_tool` in `status.md`. All downstream `/wire:pipeline-*` commands read this value and route automatically.

## Workflow

:::info[Tutorial available]

A worked example of a Pipeline and dbt engagement — using a fictional client scenario with realistic command output, agent delegation, and reviewer decisions — is available in the [Tutorial: Pipeline and dbt](../tutorials/pipeline-dbt).

> **Tip**: Run `/wire:playbook-generate <release-folder>` after the pipeline design is approved to generate a visual delivery plan.

## Business rules discovery (optional first phase)

New in 4.0. `/wire:business-rules-generate` runs before design and establishes what
the numbers mean, one business domain at a time.

It reads the definitions that already exist — in dbt, in LookML, and through
`--import` from systems Wire cannot read such as SAP BW, Hana or SAC — then asks
the people who own the numbers to settle the ones that disagree. The output is a
register: one entry per rule, holding every competing definition with the file it
came from, what they disagree on, the decision, the named approver, and a
reconciliation query that runs at generate time rather than in QA.

A rule nobody has decided is recorded with status `unknown`, which passes
validate. That is the point of it: a register has to be able to say "nobody has
agreed whether in-store orders are in this figure", because that sentence is what
stops the number being wrong nine months later.

**The gate is advisory.** ``pipeline_design-generate`` warns when the register has not been
reviewed, asks for a one-line reason, records it as an `advisory_skip`, and
proceeds. Skipping is a real choice; what matters is that the choice is visible.

## Reading an existing Modality model

New in 4.0. Where the client already models their data in Modality,
`/wire:utils-modality-link <release-folder>` points the release at it and sets
`model_source: modality`. `pipeline_design-generate` then read entities, sources and cardinality from
the `.mml` files rather than deriving them.

The requirements are still read. An entity in the model but not the requirements
is excluded with a reason; one in the requirements but not the model becomes an
open question. Every value taken from the model cites the file it came from, and
the matching validate commands gain a two-direction `modality_coverage` check.

Full reference: [Modality models as an input](../advanced/modality-models.md).

The source list and the per-entity landing tables come from `sources.mml`. The
replication tool and the schedule are not in MML and are still asked for.
