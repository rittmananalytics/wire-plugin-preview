## v4.0.0 — Precondition gate, process/data-model registries, Autopilot rewrite

**Released**: July 2026

A schema layer for release types and commands that enables deterministic, checklist-style execution, plus two private registries that externalise where Wire's process definitions and (optionally) canonical data models come from.

**The precondition gate makes phase discipline enforceable instead of advisory.** Every `-generate`/`-validate`/`-review` command now auto-delegates to a shared `precondition_gate` utility before doing anything else. It resolves the command's declared preconditions — a static list, or a `dynamic` sentinel for the handful of artifacts whose correct precondition genuinely varies by release type — and **blocks by default** if they're unmet. An override is still possible, but only explicitly: it requires a real name and reason, both recorded in `status.md` and `execution_log.md`. See [Core Concepts: The precondition gate](../getting-started/core-concepts#the-precondition-gate).

**Release-type sequencing and command specs move to a private, branch-protected `wire-process-registry`.** `wire/release-types/*.yaml` and `wire/specs/**/*.md` are now a synced, pinned mirror rather than edited in place — one required approval, admin enforcement on, never fetched live. This is the same content the precondition gate and Autopilot both read at runtime, so getting it wrong now breaks an actual engagement rather than a doc. See [The Process and Data Model Registries](../advanced/registries).

**Autopilot no longer maintains a shadow copy of Wire's process.** It resolves artifact execution order dynamically from each release type's YAML instead of ~700 lines of hardcoded sequences (which, among other things, had silently omitted the `orchestration` artifact from `full_platform` entirely), and now runs the real `/wire:*` commands rather than a parallel implementation of their logic. Self-Review Mode reads each artifact's real review spec and decides from its own stated criteria. See [Wire Autopilot](../advanced/autopilot) — substantially rewritten for this release.

**An optional, automatic canonical data model registry.** `wire-data-model-registry` is a private library of canonical entity/schema definitions and worked-example dbt SQL for six industry verticals plus cross-vertical patterns. `data_model-generate` detects it automatically — no opt-in flag — infers a plausible vertical match from the requirements already gathered, and proposes it as a starting baseline (never auto-adopted); `data_model-validate` compares against an accepted match advisorily. Because `wire-plugin`/`wire-extension` are public repos, this content is deliberately never bundled into either package — RA staff get personal-machine access via new `/wire:utils-data-model-registry-setup`, gated by their own GitHub access rather than anything Wire ships.

**`pipeline_only`, `dashboard_extension`, and `enablement` gain formal process definitions.** These release types were previously documented conceptually without a machine-readable `wire/release-types/*.yaml` backing them — the precondition gate and Autopilot's order resolution now work correctly for all twelve release types.

**Packaging fix**: `wire/release-types/*.yaml` is now actually bundled into the distributable plugin and extension — it previously wasn't, so the precondition gate and Autopilot's order resolution silently only worked inside the Wire source repo, never for a real installed-plugin engagement.

## v3.10.4 — Cube, Omni, and OAC semantic-layer options; Wire Studio and agentic_commerce removed

**Released**: July 2026

Three new semantic-layer/reporting-tool options, a real bug fix from live migration feedback, and a cleanup pass removing two low-usage features and their remaining references.

**Cube.dev, Omni Analytics, and Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC) join LookML as semantic-layer options.** Each ships as a `wire/skills/` entry activated when the engagement's semantic layer is that tool rather than Looker: `cube` encodes RA's own Cube modeling conventions and coding standards alongside Cube's core concepts and MCP server; `omni` wraps the official `exploreomni/omni-agent-skills` and adds `omni-audit`/`omni-migration` reporting-layer migration commands (gated on `migration.reporting_tool: omni`); `dbt-to-smml` and `smml-semantic-modeling` generate and hand-author OAC's SMML (Semantic Modeler Markup Language) semantic model from a dbt project, with `oac-audit`/`oac-migration` commands for reporting-layer migration (gated on `migration.reporting_tool: oac`). OAC's dialect-specific SQL concentrates in the physical layer (connection pools, physical tables, physical joins), so its migration classification happens at the physical-table level, mirroring how Omni's classification happens at the model-view level rather than per-tile.

**`dbt-audit-generate` no longer misclassifies conditionally-enabled models as disabled.** Models whose `enabled` config resolves from a `var(...)` — in-model `config()` blocks or folder-level `+enabled` in `dbt_project.yml` — are now classified `conditional:<var_name>` and kept in migration scope regardless of the var's default resolution, with dependency edges resolved via a flags-on re-parse or a documented fallback rule. `dbt-audit-validate` independently re-scans for var-driven config to catch a model still marked `true`/`false`/null-batch that should be `conditional`.

**Wire Studio (the `wire-web-ui` browser interface) and the `agentic_commerce` release type are removed entirely**, along with every reference across docs, build scripts, and tests — both showed effectively no engagement usage against BigQuery telemetry. `USER_GUIDE_droughty.md` and `USER_GUIDE_platform_migration.md`, which duplicated content already in `USER_GUIDE.md`, are also removed, along with three stale feature-design docs for work that had already shipped.

---

## v3.10.3 — dbt audit hardening, migration batching, PII/equivalency fixes

**Released**: July 2026

A round of fixes and a new command trio, each traced back to specific feedback from a live Snowflake → BigQuery migration. Additive and backward compatible.

**`dbt-audit-generate` hard-fails on an unresolvable project** — no more silently substituting a prior release's catalogue, the failure mode that produced a stale, wrong audit undetected. It resolves nested dbt projects one level down when the configured path has no `dbt_project.yml` of its own, orders batches with a real topological sort over a parsed manifest (replacing a `ref_count` heuristic that produced hundreds of forward-reference violations), scans the macro layer for platform-specific SQL — classifying each hit macro `translate` / `redesign` / `manual-review-out-of-scope` — and produces a tiered **batch-zero macro translation plan** as a first-class artifact. `dbt-audit-validate` gains a disk-reconciliation check that independently re-derives the catalogue rather than trusting generate's self-report.

**New `/wire:migration-batching-*` trio** — partitions the migration inventory into named domain batches (independently-schedulable, multi-layer slices, distinct from `dbt_audit`'s translation batches) checked against the real dependency graph. `-review` is the client adjudication gate for composition and schedule; `-validate` re-derives the graph independently, catching a batch plan drifting out of sync with reality the way a hand-drawn plan can once the true dependencies are known.

**PII policy tags resolve automatically** — `dbt-migration-generate` looks up a tag map with a case-normalised lookup instead of requiring manual per-column authoring, flagging unresolved policies `MANUAL REVIEW REQUIRED` rather than dropping them silently.

**Equivalency pins relative-date models in live mode too** — not just under the opt-in `--baseline` freeze — closing a false-divergence gap that cost a real investigation cycle on a pilot migration. Reports are now organised at the table level with explicit column-completeness and value-match lines per table.

**Housekeeping** — Atlassian MCP endpoint updated from the deprecated `/v1/sse` path to `/v1/mcp`.

---

## v3.10.2 — Platform-migration hardening

**Released**: June 2026

Hardening from a Snowflake → BigQuery lift-and-shift: migrate models faithfully, validate them deterministically, and keep them in sync with a moving source. Additive and backward compatible.

**Faithful materialisation + override hook** — `dbt-migration-generate` now preserves each model's resolved materialisation (incremental stays incremental with its strategy/partition/cluster; table stays table), instead of a blanket `materialized: table`. An engagement can diverge via a declarative override file (`migration.materialization_overrides_path`: `default: preserve` + `overrides[]` with `select`/`exclude`/`force_materialized`); the framework ships no path, no layer names, no rules.

**Deterministic, frozen-baseline equivalency** — `migration-strategy` defines the frozen baseline (instant `T`, Snowflake zero-copy clone, BigQuery Bronze watermark, expected type-translation allow-list). `equivalency-validate` gains a baseline-pin mode (`--baseline`), a deterministic-build switch, a tier-3 value-level comparator (per-column fingerprints + normalised cross-platform row hash), run-metadata capture, and `--batch` fan-out. `migration.equivalency_baseline` is a release-level field.

**Per-model register + scheduled drift gate** — `/wire:migration-register-*` records per model: source path, last-migrated commit, BigQuery target, state, and last equivalence result. `/wire:migration-drift-*` diffs the live source against each model's last-migrated commit (`dbt ls --select state:modified`), classifies new/modified/removed, flags downstream Hightouch syncs (via a new `model_sync_map.json` from `lineage-generate`), and triggers a policy-tag regeneration when a source `meta.masking_policy` changes. Ships with on-change and scheduled CI templates.

**Housekeeping** — client engagement records relocated out of the framework repo; the client name removed from all specs, docs, templates, and fixtures.

---

## v3.10.1 — Tenant carve-out variant + Metabase reporting layer

**Released**: June 2026

A tenant carve-out variant for the platform migration release type, plus Metabase reporting-layer support. Both are additive and backward compatible — a full migration with no Metabase behaves exactly as before.

**Tenant carve-out variant** — platform migration now runs in `tenant_carveout` scope as well as the default `full_migration`, set by `migration.scope` with a `migration.tenant_predicate` captured at `/wire:new`. The carve-out reuses the whole migration command set and threads tenant scoping through equivalency — the existing checks gain the predicate on both source and target, with no new check types (min/max already lives in value sampling; checksum and aggregate totals already exist; schema stays structural) — and through the security/IAM chain: tenant-scoped vs shared role classification → a two-project / tenant-scoped IAM model with a row-level security predicate → tenant-scoped GRANTs and the RLS policy in `04_security.sql`, reusing the existing PII policy-tag taxonomy.

**New carve-out commands** — `/wire:region-tagging-*` classifies in-scope items into confident-region / shared-row-level / global-deferred buckets (candidates for adjudication, never a binary include/exclude or auto-removal; `-review` is the human adjudication gate). `/wire:data-residency-assessment-*` produces the GDPR and data-residency assessment including the legal review of the historical data window — RA prepares it as data processor and flags every point needing the client's DPO/legal determination, with `-review` as the client sign-off gate. `/wire:bulk-copy-migration-*` does a Snowflake → BigQuery bulk historical copy (BigQuery Data Transfer Service / GCS-staged) in place of re-ingestion, two-stage with an equivalency gate between pilot partition and remainder, under a scoped service account with a tenant guard. `/wire:logical-access-uat-*` proves region-scoped access isolation — `-validate` requires at least one negative test per IAM boundary in `04_security.sql`, and `-review` is the isolation-proof sign-off before cutover.

**Metabase reporting-layer support** — Wire's reporting-layer support was Looker-only. Set `migration.reporting_tool: metabase` to enable `/wire:metabase-audit-*` and `/wire:metabase-migration-*`, a general capability for any migration where the client uses Metabase, not gated by `migration.scope`. The audit catalogues collections, dashboards, cards (with SQL), database connections, and permission groups; the migration translates card SQL to BigQuery, remaps permission groups, validates on a throwaway decoy collection, and repoints the Metabase database connection from Snowflake to BigQuery in two stages with per-stage rollback (it requires a client-supplied query inventory). Both build on the imported `metabase` skill, wrapping the upstream `metabase/agent-skills`.

---

## v3.10.0 — Platform-migration hardening

**Released**: June 2026

Platform-migration hardening ahead of a full Snowflake → BigQuery migration. A series of pilot calls turned up ways the reverse-ETL and dbt-migration commands would have misfired at estate scale; this release fixes them. All changes are additive and backward compatible.

**Reverse-ETL topology — additive PR-gated syncs in the existing repo** — the default was a parallel workspace, which is wrong when Hightouch is managed by GitHub Sync: GitHub Sync carries models and syncs but not destinations, so a new workspace forces re-authenticating every destination. The default is now additive — branch the existing config repo, add target-warehouse syncs alongside the source-warehouse ones, reuse destinations in place, and stage every change as a pull request the client reviews and merges. RA never enables/disables syncs directly. Cutover is two client-merged PRs (disable source-origin, enable target-origin). Parallel-workspace and in-place re-point remain documented alternatives.

**Decoy destination mapping** — destination safety is now a decoy ID-mapping table plus a scoped credential, not a "disabled" flag. Each test sync carries a decoy destination of the same type; production destination IDs are absent until the cutover PR swaps them back; the credential can write to decoy targets only.

**Drift-aware translation** — the command reads a per-release drift manifest and won't apply the generic `VARIANT → JSON` / `JSON_VALUE` mapping to a column that lands as `STRING` under BigLake Iceberg, mirroring any reconciliation a `dbt_migration` diff already recorded.

**Re-verified audit tags and scope gate** — approach tags are re-checked before translating (re-scanning `repoint` syncs for `::`, `FLATTEN`, `QUALIFY`, `IFF`, `NVL`, `CONVERT_TIMEZONE`, and variant-path access, reclassifying to `rewrite_model` when found), and any sync whose source model isn't built on target is deferred rather than silently included.

**Reverse-ETL audit — table/custom source resolution** — `table` and `custom` model types now have their source objects resolved (previously only some `rawSql` models did, leaving ~37% of active syncs with no recorded object). The audit reports source-resolution coverage and lists unresolved syncs explicitly.

**dbt-migration — per-model transformation log to BigQuery** — a structured record per migrated object (object, batch, dialect changes, manual-review flags, confidence) is persisted to a configurable BigQuery audit table. The `.diff.md` output is unchanged; this is additive.

**New — shared migration pre-flight gate** — a shared spec referenced by both migration generate commands confirms, before a batch starts, that the source dbt project was freshly re-synced for this batch, source objects exist and have data on target, the target environment is prepared (not a playground), and (reverse-etl) the decoy mapping and scoped credential are in place. Any failure stops the command before generating.

---

## v3.9.9 — Iterative migration loop, source registration, batch DAGs, acceptance packs

**Released**: June 2026

Four improvements to the platform migration release type, driven by observations from a live engagement pilot.

**Iterative translation+equivalency loop** — `/wire:dbt-migration-generate` now embeds a per-model closed loop directly. For each model: translate → compile-check (LIMIT 0) → run on target → three equivalency checks (row count ±0.5%, schema, 1000-row column value sampling) → auto-diagnose and fix on failure → repeat up to 5 iterations. Both source and target platform MCPs must be connected before the command starts. No mid-loop manual review prompts — the loop runs autonomously for all models in the batch, then prints a results table.

**Source repository management** — two new commands manage the source dbt project snapshot: `/wire:migration-source-register <release>` records the git repo URL (or local path), branch, and models path in `status.md`. `/wire:migration-source-refresh <release>` pulls or clones the repo into a local cache. `dbt-migration-generate` checks `migration_source.last_refreshed` at startup and warns if the snapshot is older than 24 hours.

**Mermaid batch DAGs** — `/wire:migration-strategy-generate` now generates one Mermaid flowchart per batch at `artifacts/migration_strategy/dag_batch_N.md`. Initial state: all nodes grey (not started). As `dbt-migration-generate` processes each model, nodes update in-place: orange = translated/in-progress, green = equivalency passed, red = failed after 5 iterations. DAG files are embedded in the strategy document.

**Migration acceptance packs** — after all models in a batch reach terminal state, `dbt-migration-generate` auto-generates `acceptance_pack_batch_N.md` with a per-model results table, confirmation statements, Mermaid DAG embed, and sign-off block. New command `/wire:migration-acceptance-pack-review <release> [--batch N]` presents the pack for stakeholder sign-off (Approve/Reject/Hold), appends the completed sign-off to the document, and syncs to Jira and the document store.

## v3.9.8 — dbt node selectors for migration translation; quieter telemetry

**Released**: June 2026

`/wire:dbt-migration-generate` gains `--select` and `--exclude` flags accepting dbt's full node-selection grammar — graph operators (`+vehicles`, `vehicles+`, `+vehicles+`, `2+vehicles`, `@vehicles`), space-separated unions, comma-separated intersections, and `tag:` / `config.materialized:` / `path:` set selectors. This scopes which models a migration translates by their graph relationships — for example `--select +vehicles` translates `vehicles` plus everything upstream of it, the natural shape for a lift-and-shift pilot slice.

Wire resolves the selector itself over the source project's dependency graph — **no dbt binary is required**. The graph is read from the source project's `target/manifest.json` (a plain JSON artifact, no warehouse connection), with a fallback that parses `ref()`/`source()` and YAML config when no manifest is present. Before translating, Wire prints the resolved model list for confirmation and aborts if the selector matches nothing. `--select` cannot be combined with `--batch`/`--model`/`--models`; a bare `--select vehicles` behaves exactly like `--model vehicles`.

**Quieter telemetry** — anonymous usage tracking no longer runs as visible Bash tool calls inside every command. On the Claude Code plugin it moves to a `UserPromptExpansion` hook that fires when a `/wire:` command runs, so nothing clutters the console. Behaviour is unchanged: still anonymous, still opt-out with `WIRE_TELEMETRY=false`. The Gemini CLI extension, which has no hook system, uses a single backgrounded call instead.

---

## v3.9.7 — Migration reliability: post-execution hooks, stale artifact detection, Data Safety blocks, ingestion pre-flight

**Released**: June 2026

Post-execution hooks are now on every migration spec. All 16 migration generate and 16 migration validate commands run execution log → Jira sync → docstore sync → auto-commit after every run, bringing them into line with non-migration commands. A new `specs/utils/commit.md` utility handles the git commit step.

**Stale artifact detection** — all 16 migration generate commands now prompt before overwriting an already-complete artifact. If `generate: complete` is set in `status.md` or the output file already exists, the command asks for confirmation. First-time runs see no friction.

**Data Safety blocks** — `/wire:dbt-migration-generate`, `/wire:ingestion-migration-generate`, `/wire:equivalency-validate`, and `/wire:reverse-etl-migration-generate` now emit a named READ ONLY reminder before starting, listing blocked production project IDs from `data_safety.production_projects`. Production project IDs are collected during `/wire:new` setup for `platform_migration` releases.

**Ingestion pre-flight expanded** — `/wire:ingestion-migration-generate` now probes all ingestion tools in scope before starting, not just Fivetran. It reads the audit for every distinct tool with `include_in_migration: true` connectors and checks each one's MCP server or API credentials. Coverage: Fivetran, RudderStack, Coupler.io (MCP); Airbyte, Segment (API env vars); Stitch/other (runbook-only). Auth failures halt the run; unconfigured tools fall to the runbook path.

**`/wire:mcp` simplified** — `update` and `auth` subcommands removed (wrappers around `claude mcp` with no Wire-specific value). Now `list`, `view`, and `check` only. New `check [release-folder]` subcommand probes all MCP servers required by a release and reports CONNECTED / AUTH_REQUIRED / UNAVAILABLE / NOT_CONFIGURED per server. The platform_migration playbook session start sequence is now: `/wire:start` → `/wire:mcp check` → next command.

Other improvements: `/wire:start` adds a Recent Activity table from `execution_log.md`; `/wire:new` detects duplicate releases before creating; `/wire:target-setup-generate` outputs a `~/.dbt/profiles.yml` block to the console; Jira `state_mapping` in `status.md` overrides default workflow transition labels.

---

## v3.9.6 — MCP-driven ingestion migration, parallel dbt agents, Looker mockup refinements

**Released**: June 2026

**Ingestion migration is now MCP-driven.** `/wire:ingestion-migration-generate` probes the relevant ingestion tool's MCP server (Fivetran, Airbyte, etc.), creates new connectors on the target destination, and generates connect card URLs for credential entry — no manual UI steps beyond opening each link. Wire always creates new connectors; it never edits or re-points a source connector mid-parallel-run. The runbook fallback applies when the MCP server is unreachable.

**dbt migration now uses parallel agents within each batch.** Models are split into groups of ~5 and one `wire:migration-specialist` agent is spawned per group simultaneously — a 20-model batch runs as 4 agents in parallel. Translated models preserve the source project's folder structure (`models/staging/stripe/stg_x.sql` → `migration/dbt/staging/stripe/stg_x.sql`).

**Looker dashboard mockup** visual refinements: PNG image assets replace SVG placeholders for the logo, Create button, and toolbar strip; chart colours use the Google standard palette (`#4285F4`, `#EA4335`, `#FBBC04`, `#34A853`, `#FF6D00`, `#7E57C2`); font weight 400 globally on labels, tabs, table headers, and chart axes; KPI tile accent bars removed; tiles centred; no freshness label; no filter count badges.

---

## v3.9.5 — Auto-delegation for all generate commands + docs expansion

**Released**: June 2026

Every generate command now auto-delegates to its specialist agent — not just migration commands. v3.9.5 extends the delegation protocol to all 44 remaining generate specs across requirements, discovery, design, development, testing, deployment, and enablement.

**Key changes**:
- 11 new shared utility specs (`specs/utils/*_delegate.md`) — same 4-step protocol as the migration delegate: check agent definition, re-entrancy guard, dispatch to specialist, inline fallback
- Auto-delegation preamble added to all 44 non-migration generate specs
- Docs site: [How Wire Works](../getting-started/how-wire-works) page added to Getting Started
- Docs site: mermaid diagrams now centred sitewide
- Docs site: "First release?" info admonition added before `/wire:new` block in all 12 release-type tutorials
- Docs site: [Platform Migration](../release-types/platform-migration) `## MCP server connections` section — Snowflake, BigQuery, Fivetran, RudderStack, Coupler.io, Segment, Airbyte, Hightouch, VPC tunnel
- Homepage colour updated to `#4F60FF`, feature highlights corrected to 50+ slash commands
- `LICENSE` now included in the wire-plugin dist package

---

## v3.9.4 — Docs cleanup and bundling fix

**Released**: June 2026

Version strings and documentation pages updated to reflect v3.9.3/v3.9.4 changes. Docusaurus docs-site bundled into the plugin release via `build-packages.sh`. No spec or behaviour changes beyond v3.9.3.

---

## v3.9.3 — Migration generate commands auto-delegate to `migration-specialist`

**Released**: June 2026

All 16 migration `generate` commands now check for the `wire:migration-specialist` agent definition and dispatch to it automatically — closing the gap where `delegate.md` documented per-command auto-delegation but no individual migration spec implemented it.

**Key changes**:
- New shared utility spec `specs/utils/migration_agent_delegate.md` — 4-step delegation protocol: check for agent definition, re-entrancy guard, dispatch to `wire:migration-specialist`, inline fallback
- Auto-delegation preamble added to all 16 migration generate specs: `target-setup`, `dbt-migration`, `ingestion-migration`, `migration-strategy`, `migration-inventory`, `cutover`, `db-object-audit`, `dbt-audit`, `ingestion-audit`, `orchestration-audit`, `orchestration-migration`, `reverse-etl-audit`, `reverse-etl-migration`, `security-audit`, `migration-report`, `lineage`
- `utils/migration-agent-delegate` compiled as a registered command in the plugin so installed instances resolve the spec reference at runtime

See [Wire Agents](../advanced/wire-agents) and [Platform Migration](../release-types/platform-migration) for full details.

---

## v3.9.2 — `dashboard-mock-developer` and `mock-data-developer` agents

**Released**: June 2026

Two new specialist agents activate exclusively for `dashboard_first` releases, bringing the total to 14.

**`dashboard-mock-developer`** owns the interactive mockup phase. It generates an HTML mock immediately from requirements, iterates with you until approved, then produces three derived artifacts atomically: `dashboard_visualization_catalog.csv`, `dashboard_spec.md`, and `data_model_requirements.md`. The last file is the primary input for `data-designer` and `mock-data-developer`.

**`mock-data-developer`** handles seed data and data refactor — two time-separated phases. Phase 1: CSV seed files with referential integrity and domain-realistic distributions, allowing `dbt seed && dbt run` before any client data access. Phase 2: repoints staging models from seeds to real client sources once access is confirmed, with a written refactor plan before any code changes.

See [Wire Agents](../advanced/wire-agents) and [Dashboard-First](../release-types/dashboard-first) for full details.

---

## v3.9.1 — Fan-out parallelism for large dbt model sets

**Released**: June 2026

`/wire:delegate` gains fan-out parallelism: when a dbt layer has more than 5 models, it splits the layer into batches of 5 and runs one `dbt-developer` agent per batch in parallel. Layers remain sequential (staging → integration → warehouse); agents within each layer wave run concurrently. The same fan-out applies to `semantic-layer-developer` (by explore) and `migration-specialist` (by source system).

---

## v3.9.0 — Wire Agents Phase 1: 12 Specialists + `/wire:delegate`

**Released**: June 2026

The agent taxonomy expands to 12 specialists covering every Wire release type. The orchestration command is rewritten for local execution — no managed agents API required, no external API key beyond the user's existing Claude Code subscription.

### New specialist agents

| Agent | Release types |
|---|---|
| `discovery-analyst` | discovery, sop_discovery |
| `data-designer` | full_platform, pipeline_only, dbt_development |
| `pipeline-engineer` | full_platform, pipeline_only |
| `dbt-developer` | full_platform, pipeline_only, dbt_development |
| `semantic-layer-developer` | full_platform, dbt_development |
| `orchestration-engineer` | full_platform, pipeline_only |
| `data-quality-engineer` | full_platform, dbt_development |
| `migration-specialist` | platform_migration |
| `delivery-lead` | all release types |
| `agentic-data-stack-developer` | agentic_data_stack |
| `agentic-commerce-developer` | agentic_commerce |
| `qa-agent` | all release types |

### Key changes

- **`/wire:delegate`** replaces `/wire:orchestrate` — dispatches pending release work to specialist subagents using Claude Code's native Agent tool. Runs on the user's workstation, using their existing API key. No managed agents service needed.
- Each agent appends non-obvious decisions to `decisions.md` as it works — downstream agents and human reviewers use this as a lightweight audit trail.
- **Auto-delegation**: individual generate and validate commands now delegate to the appropriate specialist automatically. Review commands stay in the main session.
- All 12 agent definitions are bundled into the distributed plugin under `agents/`.

See [Wire Agents](../advanced/wire-agents) for full usage.

## v3.8.6 — Wire Agents Phase 1: Initial Eight Agents

**Released**: June 2026

First cut of the specialist agent system. Superseded by v3.9.0 which expanded the taxonomy and replaced the orchestration model.

- Eight initial agents: `dbt-developer`, `lookml-developer`, `dashboard-prototyper`, `migration-auditor`, `qa-agent`, `data-quality-agent`, `stakeholder-interviewer`, `playbook-generator`
- `/wire:orchestrate` command (replaced by `/wire:delegate` in v3.9.0)
- `status.md` gains an agents block: mode, active sessions, completed sessions
- `/wire:upgrade` surfaces `/wire:orchestrate` for releases created before v3.8.6

---

## v3.8.5 — Wire-Aware PR Template

**Released**: June 2026

- New **`/wire:utils-pr-create`** command — reads `execution_log.md` and `status.md` to auto-populate a pull request body
- `/wire:new` Step 10.5 now scaffolds `.github/pull_request_template.md` at engagement setup
- PR template sections: release folder, artifacts changed, Wire commands run, Wire commands next, Jira/Linear links

---

## v3.8.4 — dbt Migration Companion YAML Coverage

**Released**: June 2026

`dbt-migration-generate` and `dbt-migration-validate` now cover the companion schema/properties YAML alongside the model SQL.

- Explicit repointing of `sources.yml` to the target namespace (parameterised `database`/`schema`)
- Translation of source-dialect SQL inside singular tests, `where:` filters, and `dbt_utils`/`dbt_expectations` arguments
- Column-level `policy_tags`/`meta` authored into the YAML when column protection is dbt-managed
- New validate **Check 7**: enforces companion-YAML coverage — un-repointed `sources.yml`, untranslated test SQL, or dropped policy-tag config all fail

---

## v3.8.3 — Reverse ETL Parallel-Workspace Migration

**Released**: June 2026

Hightouch migration defaults changed to reduce production risk during warehouse migrations.

- **Parallel-workspace topology** (new default): clone the Hightouch config repo into a fresh workspace pointed at the target warehouse, validate with syncs disabled, then enable — leaving the source-backed workspace untouched until cutover. In-place source re-point retained as a fallback.
- Validation is now **preview-based against a frozen source baseline**: destination connections present but disabled; sync previews and record-level inspection only.
- Added **sync-level transformation review**: field mappings, computed fields, sync filters, match/identity-resolution rules, and audience inclusion/exclusion per sync — a matching model output doesn't guarantee a matching sync.

---

## v3.8.2 — `/wire:upgrade` and Wire Adoption Review

**Released**: June 2026

### `/wire:upgrade`

Brings an existing release `status.md` up to date with the current plugin version's schema.

- Adds missing YAML sections and keys from the canonical template for the release type
- Stamps `wire_plugin_version` and `last_upgraded_at`
- Surfaces new commands that weren't available when the release was created
- `--dry-run` flag to preview changes without modifying files
- Idempotent — safe to re-run. Complements `/wire:migrate` (which handles layout changes); `/wire:upgrade` handles schema drift within an already-correct layout.

### `cowork-wire-adoption-review` skill

New Wire Work plugin skill — generates structured Wire and Claude Code adoption reports from BigQuery telemetry (`ra-development.analytics.coding_agent_prompts_fact`).

Three report types:
- **Project-level**: adoption rate, command usage, session lifecycle compliance, discovery phase gap analysis, recurring manual patterns, recommendations
- **Consultant-level**: individual usage patterns across engagements, comparison to RA average
- **Company-wide**: cross-engagement analysis — what worked, what didn't, standardisation progress

Enriches from GitHub delivery repos, Jira, and Fathom meeting context when available.

## v3.8.1 — Platform Migration Translation Improvements

**Released**: June 2026

- Two new platform-pair translation examples: array-membership joins (`FLATTEN` / `IN UNNEST` / `ARRAY_CONTAINS`) and `ARRAY_AGG` null and struct-array semantics
- New `dbt_neutral_translation.md`: macro-first hierarchy (dbt built-in → `dbt_utils` → dispatched macro → `target.type` last) and equivalence-testing backbone for dual-target projects
- New `snowflake_to_bigquery/translation_reference.md`: exhaustive deep reference with a 25-item silent-behaviour-change checklist
- New **`/wire:dbt-migration-lint`**: static, offline pre-warehouse equivalence lint (dialect parse-check + silent-behaviour-change rules) run before the live equivalency loop
- New feature-detection tags: `flatten_join`, `array_agg`, `in_unnest`

## v3.8.0 — Droughty Integration

**Released**: June 2026

Integrates the Droughty schema-introspection toolkit as a first-class Wire release type. Droughty is a bottom-up, schema-driven complement to Wire's top-down document-driven workflow.

Nine new `/wire:droughty-*` commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/wire:droughty-setup` | Install pinned Droughty, generate `profile.yaml` and `droughty_project.yaml` |
| `/wire:droughty-introspect` | Schema inventory: tables, columns, estimated row counts, PK/FK coverage |
| `/wire:droughty-dbml` | DBML entity-relationship diagram from live warehouse schema |
| `/wire:droughty-docs` | AI-generated field descriptions for all warehouse columns (requires OpenAI key) |
| `/wire:droughty-qa` | LangGraph data quality agent report (requires OpenAI key) |
| `/wire:droughty-stage` | dbt staging SQL + `sources.yml` from a BigQuery dataset |
| `/wire:droughty-dbt-tests` | Pattern-based `schema.yml` tests from deployed table schema |
| `/wire:droughty-lookml` | Base LookML views from deployed dbt tables; writes to `views/generated/` |
| `/wire:droughty-generate` | Full Droughty phase in sequence |

Two operating modes: **discovery/audit** (maps an existing warehouse — no dbt deployment needed) and **post-dbt** (generates the base LookML and test layer from deployed dbt models, feeding into `/wire:semantic_layer-generate`).

See the [Droughty release type](../release-types/droughty) for a full walkthrough.

## v3.7.x — Platform Migration, Agentic Data Stack, Snowflake

**Released**: June 2026

Major features added across the v3.7 series:

- **v3.7.7** — Full Snowflake support: estate audit via Snowflake MCP server; all Snowflake-native object types catalogued (Dynamic Tables, Streams, Tasks, Pipes, Semantic Views, masking/row-access policies). Hightouch reverse ETL audit added as a sixth `platform_migration` audit track.
- **v3.7.5** — Interactive lineage visualisation: `/wire:lineage-generate` produces a self-contained HTML dependency explorer showing the full dbt graph from raw source to warehouse object. Six layers: Ingestion → Seeds → Staging → Integration → Warehouse → DB Objects.
- **v3.7.4** — `agentic_data_stack` gains an explicit LookML views step (`/wire:ads_lookml-views-generate/validate/review`) between canonical models and the semantic layer build.
- **v3.7.3** — **Agentic Data Stack** release type: 41 new `ads_` commands across five phases (Audit, Design, Build, Validate, Deploy). Addresses governance failures — accuracy failures in analytics agents are almost always caused by too many tables or conflicting metric definitions.
- **v3.7.0** — **Platform Migration** release type: full warehouse-to-warehouse migration lifecycle (BigQuery ↔ Snowflake ↔ Databricks) with six parallel audit tracks: database objects, dbt models, dashboards, pipelines, orchestration, and reverse ETL.
