# Release Types

The framework encodes delivery methodology as twelve release types, each defining a different ordered set of in-scope artifacts and the commands that apply to them. When you run `/wire:new` and select a release type, the framework instantiates that process definition into the release's `status.md` file.

| Type | `release_type` | Scope | Typical Duration |
|------|----------------|-------|-----------------|
| **Discovery (Shape Up)** | `discovery` | Problem definition → pitch → release brief → sprint plan | 1–2 weeks |
| **Discovery (SOP / Canonical)** | `sop_discovery` | Wide-ranging structured discovery leading to Findings Playback | 3–6 weeks |
| **Full Platform** | `full_platform` | SOW → production dashboards + trained users | 2–3 weeks |
| **Dashboard-First** | `dashboard_first` | Interactive mocks drive data model; seed data enables immediate dbt | 1–2 weeks |
| **Pipeline + dbt** | `pipeline_only` | New data pipeline + dbt transformation layer | 1–2 weeks |
| **dbt Development** | `dbt_development` | Analytics engineering on existing infrastructure | 1 week |
| **Dashboard Extension** | `dashboard_extension` | New dashboards on an existing semantic layer | 3–5 days |
| **Enablement** | `enablement` | Training and documentation for an existing platform | 2–3 days |
| **Platform Migration** | `platform_migration` | Full lifecycle migration from one warehouse stack to another, through to production-verified code in the client's repo. Runs full-platform or as a **[tenant carve-out](../release-types/tenant-carveout)** (extract one tenant into its own target), set by `migration.scope`. At scale, runs as a director-plus-agent-fleet (v3.11.0): the consultant issues rulings, the agent invokes the commands | 4–16 weeks |
| **Agentic Data Stack** | `agentic_data_stack` | AI analytics overlay for an existing data platform | 4–6 weeks |
| **Droughty** | `droughty` | Schema introspection and base-layer generation | 1–3 days |
| **Custom** | `custom` | Bespoke scope derived from SoW or project documents | Varies |

## You do not have to know the command sequence

Every release type below is a defined sequence of artifacts with explicit
dependencies between them. **Since v4.0.0, on Claude Code, Wire reads that
sequence for you.** Say what you want done and it works out what is runnable,
names the command, runs it, and stops at every review gate for your decision.

That also means the choice below is one you make in conversation: point Wire at
the SOW and it proposes a release type **with its reason** for you to confirm,
rather than asking you to pick from a list cold. Where a release type offers
profiles — `dashboard_first` (`seeded` or `live_data`) and `sop_discovery`
(`diagnostic` or `modelling_led`) — `/wire:new` now asks which, instead of
applying the default silently.

See [The Release Director Model](../advanced/release-director).

## Choosing the right release type

- **New engagement, scope can be shaped in 1–2 weeks** → **Discovery (Shape Up)**
- **New engagement, scope genuinely unknown, requires structured discovery** → **Discovery (SOP / Canonical)**
- **Client needs a new data source connected end-to-end to a dashboard** → **Full Platform**
- **Early stakeholder feedback via interactive mocks before building the data layer** → **Dashboard-First**
- **Client has a BI tool and just needs new data flowing in** → **Pipeline + dbt**
- **Data is already in the warehouse; need to build the transformation layer** → **dbt Development**
- **Semantic layer already has the data; adding new dashboards** → **Dashboard Extension**
- **Platform exists; engaged to train and document it** → **Enablement**
- **Migrating an existing data platform between warehouses** → **Platform Migration** (full-platform, or a [tenant carve-out](../release-types/tenant-carveout) to extract a single tenant)
- **Client wants an AI that answers business questions reliably from their warehouse** → **Agentic Data Stack**
- **Need to map an existing warehouse quickly before starting design work** → **Droughty** (discovery mode)
- **Bespoke deliverables that don't fit any standard type** → **Custom**

## Key distinctions

**Discovery (Shape Up) vs Discovery (SOP / Canonical)**: Use Shape Up when the problem domain is understood and you can shape a solution in a week or two. Use SOP / Canonical when you genuinely do not yet know what to build, stakeholder alignment is low, or this is the first analytics engagement at the client.

**Full Platform vs Dashboard-First**: Both produce the same end result. Full Platform follows the traditional flow: requirements → conceptual model → pipeline design → data model → dbt → dashboards. Dashboard-First inverts this: requirements → interactive dashboard mocks → visualization catalog → data model → seed data → dbt → dashboards → data refactor.

**When to start with Platform Migration vs a discovery release**: A discovery release is strongly recommended before starting a migration if the scope is not yet confirmed — migration is irreversible once Fivetran connectors are cut over.
