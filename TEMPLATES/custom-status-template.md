# Release budget — what an agent may spend on this release

# defaults: lanes_max 4, no warehouse restriction, stop at decisions. The release
# director sets it in prose ("two lanes, nothing against a warehouse, stop at
# decisions") and the orchestrating session writes the block. /wire:upgrade never
# writes one: an absent block means no budget was set, not a budget of defaults.
