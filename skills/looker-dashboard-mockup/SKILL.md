name: looker-dashboard-mockup
description: >
  Generates pixel-accurate, interactive Looker dashboard HTML mockups from a plain-language
  description of the dashboard's contents. Use this skill whenever the user asks to mock up,
  prototype, visualise, or design a Looker dashboard — including requests like "create a Looker
  dashboard for X", "what would a Looker dashboard for X look like", "mock up a dashboard showing
  Y metrics", "prototype a Looker view for Z data", or any request to visualise analytics data in
  a Looker-style layout. Also trigger when the user shares a list of KPIs, charts, or data tables
  and asks how they would look in Looker. The output is a single self-contained HTML file that
  faithfully reproduces the Looker UI chrome (header, sidebar, filter pills, title bar, footer)
  and uses Chart.js for interactive charts.

# Looker Dashboard Mockup Generator

## On Activation

Before proceeding, append a one-line entry to `.wire/execution_log.md`:

```
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | looker-dashboard-mockup | activated | Looker dashboard mockup work triggered this skill |
```

If `.wire/execution_log.md` does not exist, create it with the standard header first (see `specs/utils/execution_log.md`). If no `.wire/` directory exists in the current repo, skip this step.



Generates a single self-contained HTML file that looks and behaves like a real Looker dashboard.
The output uses the official Looker design system (Google Sans, teal sidebar, blue filter pills,
centred KPI tiles, Google-standard chart colours, Chart.js charts) and includes all Looker UI chrome.

## Step 1 — Gather the Specification

Before generating anything, extract (or ask for) these details from the user's request:

| Field | What to ask / infer |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Dashboard title** | Required — what is this dashboard called? |
| **Data domain** | e.g. Sales Pipeline, Delivery Health, Finance, Marketing |
| **KPI tiles** | Up to 6 — metric name, example value, unit, trend direction and %, sub-label |
| **Charts** | For each: title, chart type (line/bar/doughnut/horizontal-bar/area), axes labels, data series names |
| **Table** | Column headers, 5–8 sample rows of realistic data |
| **Filter pills** | Which dimensions should appear as filters (e.g. Date Range, Client, Status) |
| **Tabs** | Tab names across the top (e.g. Overview, Pipeline, Finance) |
| **Client / brand name** | Used in breadcrumb and footer |

If any field is missing and cannot be reasonably inferred from context, ask before generating.
For everything else, invent plausible but realistic sample data — never leave tiles or charts empty.

## Step 2 — Read the Design Reference

**Before writing any HTML**, read the design system reference:

```
wire/skills/looker-dashboard-mockup/references/design-system.md
```

This file contains:
- All CSS custom properties (colours, radius, shadows)
- Component class definitions (stat-card, chart-card, filter-pill, etc.)
- Chart.js configuration patterns for every chart type
- Table markup patterns including mini-bar, badge, and sort-icon helpers
- The full sidebar and header HTML structure

Do not guess at colours or class names — use the reference verbatim.

## Step 3 — Generate the HTML

Produce **one complete, self-contained HTML file** following this structure:

```
<head>
  Google Sans font import
  Chart.js CDN (4.4.1 from cdnjs)
  <style> — full CSS from design-system.md, no Tailwind/external CSS needed
</style>

<body>
  <header>        — looker_logo.png (35px), hamburger, toolbar_icons.png (35px), avatar initials
  <div.body>
    <aside.sidebar> — create_button.png (70% width), nav sections, active state on current tab
    <main.main>
      <div.titlebar>   — Breadcrumb + h1 + action icons (heart, folder, refresh, more)
      <div.filter-bar> — One .filter-pill-wrap per filter dimension + Run button
      <div.tab-bar>    — One .tab per tab, first tab .active
      <div.content>    — KPI grid, chart rows, table, bottom chart row
  <footer>        — Dashboard name + disclaimer + "Prepared by · date"

  <script>
    Chart.defaults setup
    One new Chart(...) per canvas
    toggleSidebar(), setActive(), switchTab() helpers
  </script>
```

### Content Layout Rules

**KPI grid**: `grid-template-columns: repeat(N, 1fr)` where N = number of KPIs (max 5).
Each stat-card gets a `--card-accent` pointing to a different `--chart-N` variable.

**Chart rows**: use CSS grid.
- Single wide chart: `grid-template-columns: 1fr`
- Two charts side by side: `grid-template-columns: 3fr 2fr` (wide + narrow)
- Three charts: `grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr 1fr`
- Never put more than 3 charts in one row.

**Table**: always include a bottom strip with Data / Results / SQL tabs and a row-count + timing indicator.

**Charts**: set `canvas` heights explicitly via a wrapper `div` with `height: Npx`. Use:
- Line/area: `height: 200px` in the main row, `height: 180px` in the bottom row
- Doughnut: `height: 200px` — always `cutout: '62%'`, legend `position: 'right'` or `'bottom'`
- Horizontal bar: `height: 180px`, `indexAxis: 'y'`
- Vertical bar: `height: 200px`

### Data Realism Rules

- Use realistic but anonymised values (£/$/€ with K/M suffixes for money)
- Trend arrows: ↑ for positive → success colour, ↓ for negative → destructive colour, → for neutral → muted
- Table badges: Green/Amber/Red for RAG-style status; Blue for state labels
- Mini progress bars in tables: width% matches a percentage column value
- Chart data should tell a coherent story — don't just use sequential numbers

### Stat Card Colour Cycling

Cycle through `--chart-1` through `--chart-6` for `--card-accent`:
1 → chart-1 (blue), 2 → chart-3 (yellow), 3 → chart-5 (orange), 4 → chart-6 (teal), 5 → chart-2 (purple), 6 → chart-4 (red)

## Step 4 — Output the File

Write the complete HTML to the path specified by the caller (e.g. `.wire/<project-folder>/design/mockups/<dashboard-slug>.html`),
where `<dashboard-slug>` is a lowercase-hyphenated version of the dashboard title.

After writing the HTML, copy the three image assets into the **same directory** as the HTML file:
- `wire/skills/looker-dashboard-mockup/references/looker_logo.png`
- `wire/skills/looker-dashboard-mockup/references/create_button.png`
- `wire/skills/looker-dashboard-mockup/references/toolbar_icons.png`

The HTML references these by filename only (`src="looker_logo.png"` etc.), so they must sit alongside the HTML for the images to load when opened in a browser.

Follow up with a brief summary (3–5 bullet points) of what was generated — tile names, chart types,
table columns — so the user can quickly verify it matches their intent without opening the file.

## Step 5 — Iteration

If the user asks to change specific tiles, charts, or data:
- Re-read the design-system.md reference to confirm you're using correct class names
- Make targeted edits to the relevant `<canvas>` block or stat-card HTML
- Re-write the full file (do not produce partial diffs — always output the complete file)
- Present the updated file
