# Fivetran MCP Skill

## On Activation

Before proceeding, append a one-line entry to `.wire/execution_log.md`:

```
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | fivetran | activated | Fivetran pipeline work triggered this skill |
```

If `.wire/execution_log.md` does not exist, create it with the standard header first (see `specs/utils/execution_log.md`). If no `.wire/` directory exists in the current repo, skip this step.



## When This Skill Activates

Activate when the user asks about:
- Listing, creating, modifying, pausing, or deleting Fivetran connections
- Checking sync status or triggering syncs
- Managing destinations (data warehouses)
- Managing transformation projects or dbt transformations
- Working with groups, users, webhooks, or hybrid deployment agents
- Schema / column / table configuration
- Any phrase containing: "Fivetran", "connector", "sync", "pipeline", "destination", "data warehouse"

---

## Authentication

The Fivetran MCP Server authenticates per-request using two headers:
- `X-Fivetran-API-Key` — your Fivetran API key
- `X-Fivetran-API-Secret` — your Fivetran API secret

Get credentials from: **Fivetran dashboard → Account → Settings → API Config**

When using Claude Code with this MCP server configured, credentials are passed via the MCP client setup — you do not need to include them in tool calls.

---

## Key Concepts

**connection_id**: Fivetran's internal ID for a connector (e.g. `unaffected_school`). Use `list_connections` to find IDs.

**group_id**: The destination group ID. Use `list_groups` to find IDs. Connections are associated with groups.

**service**: The connector type slug (e.g. `salesforce`, `postgres`, `calendly`, `hubspot`). Use `list_metadata_connectors` or `get_metadata_connector_config` to discover the correct service slug and its required config fields.

**Auth vs Config for connectors**: Some connectors (e.g. Calendly, Google Analytics) use an `auth` object with `access_token` for OAuth-based authentication, while others use a `config` object with API keys. Always call `get_metadata_connector_config` first when creating a new connector type to check which fields are required and whether they go in `config` or `auth`.

**Write operations**: Tools marked ⚠️ mutate data. The server has a `FIVETRAN_ALLOW_WRITES` env var — if set to `false`, all write operations are blocked. By default, writes are allowed.

---

## Common Use Cases

### 1. List all connections

```
"Show me all my Fivetran connections"
"List connections grouped by destination"
```

Tool: `list_connections` (no arguments required — auto-paginates)

Follow-up: use `list_connections_in_group` with a `group_id` to filter by destination.

---

### 2. Check connection status

```
"What's the status of my Salesforce connection?"
"Are any connections failing?"
"When did my HubSpot connector last sync?"
```

Tools:
- `list_connections` — scan `status.setup_state` and `succeeded_at` / `failed_at` fields
- `get_connection_details` — for a single connection's full status and config
- `get_connection_state` — for granular sync state

---

### 3. Trigger a sync

```
"Sync my Salesforce connection now"
"Force a full historical re-sync of my Stripe connection"
"Re-sync just the orders table in my Postgres connection"
```

Tools:
- `sync_connection` — immediate incremental sync. Pass `{"force": true}` in `request_body` to force.
- `resync_connection` — full historical re-sync (expensive — use sparingly)
- `resync_tables` — re-sync specific tables only

---

### 4. Pause and resume connections

```
"Pause all my connections during maintenance"
"Resume the postgres_production connection"
```

Tool: `modify_connection` with `request_body: {"paused": true}` or `{"paused": false}`

---

### 5. Create a new connection

```
"Create a new Calendly connection syncing to the ra-development destination"
"Set up a HubSpot connector in the marketing group"
```

Workflow:
1. `get_metadata_connector_config` with the service slug — check which fields go in `config` vs `auth`
2. `list_groups` — find the destination `group_id`
3. `create_connection` with:
   - `service`: connector type slug
   - `schema`: destination schema name (permanent, cannot be changed)
   - `group_id`: destination group ID
   - `config`: service-specific config fields (schema is merged in automatically)
   - `auth` (if required): OAuth tokens (use `modify_connection` after creation to set auth)
4. `run_connection_setup_tests` — verify connectivity after creation

**Note on OAuth connectors** (Calendly, Google Analytics, etc.): Create the connection first with `create_connection`, then call `modify_connection` with `{"auth": {"access_token": "..."}}` to add the token. The setup test will fail until auth is provided.

---

### 6. Modify connection settings

```
"Change Salesforce to sync every hour"
"Update the sync frequency of my Stripe connection to 6 hours"
```

Tool: `modify_connection` with `request_body: {"sync_frequency": 60}` (value in minutes)

Common `sync_frequency` values: 5, 15, 30, 60, 180, 360, 720, 1440

---

### 7. Delete a connection

```
"Delete the old Stripe test connection"
```

Tool: `delete_connection` — **DESTRUCTIVE, cannot be undone**. Always confirm with the user before calling.

---

### 8. Manage schema / table / column sync config

```
"Which tables are being synced from my Postgres connection?"
"Disable the internal_logs table from syncing"
"Hash the email column in the users table"
```

Tools:
- `get_connection_schema_config` — view all schemas, tables, columns and their enabled status
- `modify_connection_table_config` — enable/disable a table
- `modify_connection_column_config` — enable/disable or hash a column (`hashed: true` anonymises values)
- `reload_connection_schema_config` — discover new tables added at source since last reload
- `modify_connection_schema_config` — bulk update multiple schemas/tables at once

---

### 9. List and manage destinations

```
"What destinations do I have?"
"Show me the config for my BigQuery destination"
```

Tools:
- `list_destinations` — all destinations
- `get_destination_details` — single destination config
- `run_destination_setup_tests` — verify destination connectivity

---

### 10. Work with groups

```
"List all my destination groups"
"Who's in the ra-development group?"
"Add user@company.com to the marketing group"
```

Tools:
- `list_groups` — all groups with their IDs
- `get_group_details` — single group
- `list_users_in_group` — users with access to a group
- `add_user_to_group` / `delete_user_from_group` — manage group membership
- `list_connections_in_group` — all connections in a specific destination

---

### 11. Manage dbt transformations

```
"List my transformation projects"
"Run the nightly dbt transformation"
"Cancel the transformation that's been running too long"
```

Tools:
- `list_transformation_projects` — all projects
- `list_transformations` — all transformations
- `get_transformation_details` — single transformation
- `run_transformation` — trigger a run
- `cancel_transformation` — cancel a running transformation
- `upgrade_transformation_package` — upgrade dbt package version

---

### 12. Manage webhooks

```
"List my webhooks"
"Create a webhook for sync completion events"
"Test the webhook at https://my-endpoint.com"
```

Tools:
- `list_webhooks` — all webhooks
- `create_account_webhook` — account-level webhook
- `create_group_webhook` — group-level webhook
- `test_webhook` — send a test event
- `delete_webhook` — remove a webhook

---

### 13. Discover connector types

```
"What connectors does Fivetran support?"
"What config fields does the Calendly connector need?"
"What scopes does the HubSpot connector require?"
```

Tools:
- `list_metadata_connectors` — all connector types with metadata
- `get_metadata_connector_config` — detailed config schema for a specific connector (shows required `config` and `auth` fields)
- `list_public_connectors` — public connector list (no auth required)

---

### 14. Get a connection's dashboard URL

```
"Give me the link to the Salesforce connection in Fivetran"
```

Tool: `get_connection_url` with `connection_id`

---

### 15. Account information

```
"What's my Fivetran account info?"
"What plan am I on?"
```

Tool: `get_account_info` (no arguments)

## Safety Guidelines

- Always confirm with the user before calling **Destructive** tools (`delete_*`, `delete_multiple_columns_connection_config`)
- `resync_connection` triggers a full historical re-sync — this can be slow and costly for large datasets. Prefer `sync_connection` unless a full re-sync is specifically needed
- `modify_connection_column_config` with `hashed: true` anonymises data on the next sync — this is a one-way operation per sync cycle
- `schema` in `create_connection` is permanent and cannot be changed after creation — confirm the schema name before creating
